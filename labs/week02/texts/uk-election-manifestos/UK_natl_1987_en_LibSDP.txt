LIBERAL-SDP ALLIANCE: 1987

BRITAIN UNITED: THE TIME HAS COME

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOREWARD: BRITAIN UNITED

THE ALLIANCE'S VISION IS OF A BRITAIN UNITED, A BRITAIN CONFIDENT,
COMPASSIONATE AND COMPETITIVE. WE KNOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNITE OUR
COUNTRY. WE KNOW THE BRITISH PEOPLE WANT GREATER UNITY. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THE
TASK OF DRAWING BRITAIN TOGETHER AGAIN CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH
POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORM ON A SCALE NOT CONTEMPLATED IN OUR
COUNTRY FOR OVER FORTY YEARS.

AT THE LAST ELECTION, ABOUT A THIRD OF THE NATION'S VOTERS DIDN'T EVEN BOTH
TO TURN OUT.

IT'S HARD TO THINK OF A MORE DAMNING CONDEMNATION OF POLITICS IN THIS
COUNTRY.

BUT IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY PEOPLE FEEL CYNICAL AND
UNINTERESTED.

SINCE THE LAST WAR THE TORIES AND LABOUR HAVE EACH HAD SIX TURNS AT
GOVERNMENT.

MANY HONOURABLE MEN AND WOMEN ON BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD FOR THE NATION
BUT THE SYSTEM HAS DEFEATED ALL BUT A FEW.

RIGID DOGMAS, THE OVERRIDING NEED FOR PARTY UNITY, AND INDISCRIMINATE
THREE-LINE WHIPS HAVE ALL HELPED TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF CONFLICT AND
RANCOUR.

LISTEN TO PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION TIME AND COUNT HOW MANY TIMES THE SPEAKER
HAS TO CALL FOR ORDER. WE'VE HAD FORTY YEARS OF YAH-BOO POLITICS AND WHERE
HAS IT GOT US?

WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT IS PATENTLY UNFAIR TO MANY OF ITS CITIZENS. WHILE
POLITICIANS BRANDISH STATISTICS AT EACH OTHER ON TV CHAT SHOWS, WE CAN ALL
SEE WITH OUR OWN EYES WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS AND INNER
CITIES.

WE KNOW THERE IS MORE CRIME BECAUSE OUR OWN HOMES HAVE BEEN BROKEN INTO, OUR
OWN NEIGHBOURS HAVE BEEN MUGGED, OUR OWN CHILDREN HAVE BEEN OFFERED DRUGS.

WE KNOW THAT UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS A HUGE PROBLEM BECAUSE FEW FAMILIES
HAVEN'T BEEN TOUCHED BY ITS SHADOW.

FOR MANY, THE SITUATION SEEMS HOPELESS. UNABLE TO CONTEMPLATE FIVE MORE
YEARS OF UNCARING GOVERNMENT UNDER MRS THATCHER, THEY STILL DO NOT TRUST THE
LABOUR PARTY.

MR KINNOCK TRIES HARD BUT FOR HOW LONG CAN HE KEEP THE LID ON THE EXTREMISTS
OF THE LEFT?

THEY ALREADY DOMINATE SOME OF THE TOWN HALLS WHEN THE ELECTION IS OVER, WILL
THEY EMERGE AGAIN TO CLAIM THE REWARDS OF THEIR SILENCE?

MANY OF THESE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE ALLIANCE IS THE ANSWER - BUT THEY ASK
WHAT CHANCE DOES IT HAVE OF CHANGING THINGS? THE ANSWER IS - EVERY CHANCE.

AT THE LAST ELECTION, THE ALLIANCE WON NEARLY 8 MILLION VOTES, LITTLE LESS
THAN THE LABOUR PARTY.

IF JUST 72 MORE PEOPLE IN EVERY 700 VOTE FOR THE ALLIANCE THIS TIME, WE WILL
BE THE SINGLE LARGEST PARTY IN PARLIAMENT. IF JUST 5 MORE PEOPLE IN EVERY
700 SUPPORT US, WE WOULD HAVE OVER 70 SEATS AND ALMOST CERTAINLY HOLD THE
BALANCE OF POWER.

THINK OF IT. ISSUES WOULD BE JUDGED ON THEIR MERITS. WE WOULD CURB THE
TORIES' DIVISIVE POLICIES AND STOP THE DESTRUCTIVE ANTICS OF THE LABOUR
LEFT.

POLITICIANS WOULD BE FORCED TO LISTEN TO EACH OTHER AND WORK TOGETHER. THE
TWO-PARTY, TWO-CLASS PANTOMIME WOULD FINALLY BE OVER.

IT'S NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM. IT'S CLOSER NOW THAN AT ANY TIME IN OUR
HISTORY. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO MAKE IT HAPPEN IS TO VOTE ALLIANCE ON JUNE
17TH.

INTRODUCTION

THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN ELECTION LIKE THIS IN MODERN TIMES. ALL THE EVIDENCE
AND ALL THE COMMENTATORS CONFIRM THAT IT IS A THREE-WAY CONTEST WHICH THE
ALLIANCE ENTERS FROM A POSITION OF UNPRECEDENTED STRENGTH AND PROMISE. THE
OFFICIAL OPPOSITION IS FALLING APART AND IS NOW QUITE UNABLE TO PRESENT
ITSELF AS A REALISTIC ALTERNATIVE TO A GOVERNMENT WHICH PRESIDES OVER THE
WORST UNEMPLOYMENT EVER KNOWN IN THE LIFETIME OF THOSE WHO ARE OF WORKING
AGE. THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM HAS BROKEN DOWN BECAUSE IT IS ROOTED IN OUTDATED
BATTLES OF CLASS AND IDEOLOGY, AND PROVIDES NO OUTLET FOR THE VAST NUMBERS
OF PEOPLE WHO WANT INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM TO GO HAND-IN-HAND WITH SOCIAL
JUSTICE, WHO WANT THE STATE TO BACK INDUSTRY WITHOUT TRYING TO TAKE IT OVER,
WHO WANT POWER TO BE GIVEN BACK TO COMMUNITIES INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATED IN
WHITEHALL AND WHO WANT A NATION WHICH IS SOUNDLY DEFENDED BUT TAKES THE LEAD
IN THE QUEST FOR NEGOTIATED DISARMAMENT AND A FAIRER WORLD.

IN ANY GOVERNMENT THE POLICIES WHICH HAVE BEEN SET OUT IN THE ELECTION
PROGRAMME CAN ONLY TELL PART OF THE STORY OF HOW THEY WILL BEHAVE IN OFFICE.
IT IS AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT TO KNOW AND TRUST THE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES FOR
WHICH THEY STAND, AND WHICH WILL GUIDE THEIR RESPONSE TO THE NEW EVENTS AND
NEW PROBLEMS WITH WHICH GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO DEAL. THESE VALUES, WE BELIEVE,
ARE EMBODIED IN THIS JOINT PROGRAMME. THEY ARE OUR GUIDE-BOOK FOR
GOVERNMENT:

   * GOVERNMENTS ARE THERE TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE THE FREEDOM OF CITIZENS,
     TO WHOM THEY SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE AND OPEN;
   * FREEDOM MUST EXTEND TO ALL THE PEOPLE, AND GOVERNMENTS MUST THEREFORE
     WIDEN THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THOSE WHOSE LIBERTY IS LIMITED BY LACK OF
     EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, HOUSING OR HELP IN DEALING WITH
     DISABILITY;
   * GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NOT TRY TO DO WHAT CAN BE BETTER DONE BY
     INDIVIDUALS, BY COMMUNITIES, BY VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS OR BY PRIVATE
     ENTERPRISE, BUT SHOULD SET ABOUT ENABLING PEOPLE TO HELP THEMSELVES;
     HOWEVER GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE READY TO ENTER INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH
     THESE ORGANISATIONS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEMS THAT NEITHER IT NOR THEY CAN
     SOLVE ALONE;
   * DECISIONS OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE TAKEN DEMOCRATICALLY AT THE MOST
     LOCAL LEVEL COMPATIBLE WITH EFFECTIVE ACTION;
   * GOVERNMENTS SHOULD LEARN TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE TO WHOM THEY ARE
     ACCOUNTABLE;
   * GOVERNMENTS SHOULD EXERCISE THE CREATIVE LEADERSHIP TO ENABLE SOCIETY
     AS A WHOLE TO MATCH ITS NEEDS AND RESOURCES WITH THE WORK TO BE DONE -
     OF WHICH THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE IN BRITAIN TODAY;
   * GOVERNMENT MUST CHALLENGE AND CURB ALL THOSE WHO THREATEN INDIVIDUAL
     FREEDOM BY THE ABUSE OF MONOPOLY POWER, BY THE DENIAL OF RIGHTS OR BY
     CRIME AND VIOLENCE;
   * IT IS THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT TO ACT FAIRLY IN THE PURSUIT OF A
     UNITED SOCIETY, NOT TO IDENTIFY ITSELF SOLELY WITH ANY ONE SECTION OF
     SOCIETY OR REGION OF THE COUNTRY;
   * GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE POSITIVE STEPS TO ENSURE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR
     WOMEN - WHO MAKE UP 52% OF THE POPULATION - AND FOR MINORITY GROUPS
     SUCH AS THE ETHNIC COMMUNITIES.
   * GOVERNMENT MUST ENABLE SOCIETY TO TAKE THE LONGER VIEW, SETTING THE
     RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN PRESENT CONSUMPTION AND FUTURE INVESTMENT AND
     ENSURING THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY
     RESPONSIBLE.

THESE VALUES MUST ALSO GUIDE FOREIGN POLICY, WHERE THE DEFENCE OF THE NATION
GOES HAND-IN-HAND WITH THE PROMOTION OF PEACE AND FAIRNESS IN A WORLD MARKED
BY SEVERE INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE.

WE BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS CAN BE MORE OPEN, MORE ACCOUNTABLE,
MORE FAIR AND MORE IN TUNE WITH THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY IF
IT IS ALLOWED TO BREAK FREE OF THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM AND THE OLD CLASS
CONFLICT WHICH THAT SYSTEM FEEDS. OUR COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER,
AND HERE IS HOW WE BELIEVE IT CAN BE DONE.

BETTER GOVERNMENT

MOST OF THE PROBLEMS FACING OUR COUNTRY CANNOT BE SOLVED UNLESS WE GET
BETTER GOVERNMENT. THAT MEANS GOVERNMENT WHICH CAN CARRY THE PEOPLE WITH IT
IN ITS MAJOR POLICIES, AND IT MEANS GOVERNMENT WHICH THE CITIZENS CAN CALL
TO ACCOUNT. OUR SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY FAILING IN BOTH RESPECTS, AND IT IS
GETTING WORSE. UNDER OUR PROPOSALS NO GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO RIDE
ROUGHSHOD OVER THE RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS.

FIRST, WE INSIST THAT THE VOTING SYSTEM SHOULD BE REFORMED SO THAT NO
MINORITY - WHICH IS WHAT MRS. THATCHER'S PARTY WAS AT THE LAST ELECTION - IS
GIVEN AN INFLATED PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY. FEWER PEOPLE VOTED CONSERVATIVE AT
THE LAST ELECTION THAN THE ONE BEFORE, YET THE SYSTEM GAVE THE ABSOLUTE
POWER OF A MASSIVELY INCREASED MAJORITY TO MRS. THATCHER, AND ENSURED THAT
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS COULD BE LITTLE MORE THAN A TALKING SHOP. NO WONDER
LABOUR LEADERS JOIN WITH THE PRESENT CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP IN WANTING TO
KEEP THE OLD SYSTEM - THEY CAN SEE THAT IT OFFERS THE ONLY HOPE OF
INFLICTING ON THE NATION POLICIES WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE REJECT.
THE ALLIANCE WILL INTRODUCE COMMUNITY PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, USING THE
WELL-TRIED SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE SYSTEM WITH CONSTITUENCIES BASED ON
LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THIS SYSTEM ALSO GIVES THE VOTERS THE CHANCE TO SHOW
WHICH CANDIDATES THEY PREFER AND WOULD INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
TO BE ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT, AND MAKE THE ELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
ETHNIC MINORITIES MORE LIKELY. WE WILL REFORM THE VOTING SYSTEM FOR LOCAL
GOVERNMENT ON A SIMILAR BASIS, WHICH IS THE REAL ANSWER TO THE ABUSE OF
POWER BY THE TOWN HALL EXTREMISTS. FAIRLY ELECTED LOCAL COUNCILS CAN AND
SHOULD BE ENTRUSTED WITH IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT RUN
AS ONE PARTY STATES. WE WILL END THE SCANDAL WHEREBY ENGLAND, SCOTLAND AND
WALES ARE DENIED FAIR REPRESENTATION IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT; WE WILL
INTRODUCE A NEW GREAT REFORM CHARTER COVERING A RANGE OF SPECIFIC
LEGISLATION, ALL AIMED AT STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY BOTH LOCALLY AND
NATIONALLY.

WE WILL OPEN THE DOORS OF GOVERNMENT SO THAT INCOMPETENCE AND DECEIT CANNOT
BE HIDDEN BEHIND THEM. WE WILL REPEAL SECTION TWO OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS
ACT AND INTRODUCE A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT SO THAT THE PUBLIC HAVE
ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO THEIR PERSONAL
FILES, INCLUDING MEDICAL FILES, HELD ABOUT THEM BY PUBLIC BODIES AND TO
BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION LAID BY THE ACCESS TO PERSONAL FILES ACT, WHICH WAS
INTRODUCED AS A PRIVATE MEMBERS BILL BY A LIBERAL MP. WE HOPE TO STRENGTHEN
DATA PROTECTION LAWS. IN AREAS OF GOVERNMENT WHERE SECRECY IS NEEDED, WE
WILL INTRODUCE NEW SAFEGUARDS INCLUDING A COMMITTEE OF PRIVY COUNSELLORS TO
OVERSEE THE SECURITY SERVICES.

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WHITEHALL KNOWS BEST. BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER
BEEN MORE CENTRALISED THAN IT HAS BECOME UNDER MRS. THATCHER. IN EDUCATION,
HEALTH AND EVERY ASPECT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, POWER HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY
MINISTERS. AS A RESULT OF WHAT THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE DONE, AN EXTREMIST
GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE FAR MORE OPPORTUNITIES THAN EVER BEFORE TO CONTROL
PEOPLE'S LIVES. THIS CENTRALISATION IS INEFFICIENT AS WELL AS DANGEROUS. HOW
ON EARTH CAN THE MAN OR WOMAN IN WHITEHALL KNOW THE NEEDS, THE PROBLEMS AND
THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY COMMUNITY FROM SHETLAND TO THE SCILLIES? THE ALLIANCE
WILL REVERSE THIS TREND.

WE WILL INTRODUCE A CODE FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND REASSERT THE SAFEGUARDS
OF MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CIVIL SERVICE IMPARTIALITY WHICH HAVE BEEN
SEVERELY ERODED UNDER MRS. THATCHER'S GOVERNMENT AS THE HANDLING OF THE
WESTLAND AFFAIR SHOWED.

WE WILL DEVOLVE POWER TO THE NATIONS AND REGIONS OF BRITAIN. WE AIM TO
ESTABLISH AN ELECTED SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT, WELSH SENEDD AND ELECTED REGIONAL
ASSEMBLIES THROUGHOUT ENGLAND. PUBLIC SUPPORT IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROGRESS TO
BE MADE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN INITIAL DEVOLUTION ACT. THE DEVOLVED
STRUCTURE WILL REQUIRE A STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS STARTING WITH ESTABLISHING A
SCOTTISH LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WITH WIDE POWERS AND SELF-GOVERNMENT IN HER
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. THIS WOULD BE CREATED WITHIN AN OVERALL FRAMEWORK IN A
DEVOLUTION BILL WHICH SETS OUT THE OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES FOR DEVOLUTION
OF POWERS WITHIN THE UK. WALES ALREADY HAS A WELL ESTABLISHED, BUT
UNACCOUNTABLE, LAYER OF DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATION; WE THEREFORE AIM TO CREATE
A WELSH SENEDD AND WOULD PUBLISH AN EARLY GREEN PAPER ON ITS POWERS AND
RESPONSIBILITIES. THE ABOLITION OF THE GREATER LONDON COUNCIL AND THE SIX
METROPOLITAN COUNTY COUNCILS HAS CREATED A VACUUM. LONDON IS NOW THE ONLY
MAJOR CAPITAL CITY IN THE DEMOCRATIC WORLD WITHOUT A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED
LOCAL AUTHORITY. GREATER LONDON IS OF SUFFICIENT SIZE AND IMPORTANCE TO BE A
REGION IN ITSELF AND THERE IS ALREADY WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR SUCH A REGIONAL
ASSEMBLY, WHICH SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE SHALL PUBLISH
AN EARLY GREEN PAPER WITH PROPOSALS FOR AN ELECTED GREATER LONDON REGIONAL
ASSEMBLY AND SETTING OUT THE PROPOSALS, AS THE NEED AND DEMAND IS
ESTABLISHED, FOR THE CREATION OF DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS
IN ENGLAND.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS A FAIR SYSTEM OF LOCAL FINANCE WHICH THE RATES NO
LONGER PROVIDE. THE GOVERNMENT'S ALTERNATIVE OF A POLL TAX IS UNACCEPTABLE
BECAUSE IT IS GROSSLY UNFAIR: IT DOES NOT RELATE TAXATION TO THE ABILITY TO
PAY. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PLANNED INTRODUCTION OF A LOCAL INCOME TAX AS
THE MAIN SOURCE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE IN PLACE OF DOMESTIC RATES. WE
BELIEVE THAT BUSINESS RATES SHOULD BE RELATED TO ABILITY TO PAY AND WE WILL
CONSULT WITH INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE AS TO HOW THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED.

PARLIAMENT ITSELF NEEDS A SHAKE-UP. A FAIR ELECTORAL SYSTEM WILL HAVE THAT
EFFECT BUT EVEN UNDER THE PRESENT SYSTEM MANY EXISTING PARLIAMENTARY
PRACTICES WILL NOT SURVIVE FOR LONG AFTER THIS ELECTION, BECAUSE THREE MAJOR
POLITICAL FORCES WILL BE STRONGLY REPRESENTED. IT WILL NO LONGER BE POSSIBLE
FOR TWO POLITICAL PARTIES TO RUN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO SUIT THEIR OWN
CONVENIENCE. WE INTEND TO PUT THE CONTROL OF PARLIAMENTARY TIME IN THE HANDS
OF AN ALL-PARTY BUSINESS COMMITTEE AND TO MAKE MUCH MORE USE OF SELECT
COMMITTEES: WE WANT WIDELY-SUPPORTED PRIVATE MEMBERS BILLS TO HAVE
SUFFICIENT TIME TO BE DEBATED AND DECIDED UPON. IN RECENT YEARS THE HOUSE OF
LORDS HAS PROVED THE VALUE OF A SECOND CHAMBER BY ITS CAREFUL SCRUTINY OF
BILLS WHICH GOT LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE COMMONS AND BY ITS WILLINGNESS TO
DEFEAT THE GOVERNMENT ON ISSUES OF NATIONAL CONCERN. BUT THERE CAN BE NO
JUSTIFICATION FOR BASING THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE SECOND CHAMBER SO LARGELY ON
HEREDITY AND ON THE WHIM OF PRIME MINISTERS. THE ALLIANCE WILL WORK TOWARDS
A REFORM OF THE SECOND CHAMBER LINKED WITH OUR DEVOLUTION PROPOSALS SO THAT
IT WILL INCLUDE MEMBERS ELECTED FROM THE REGIONS AND NATIONS OF BRITAIN AND
WILL PHASE OUT THE RIGHTS OF HEREDITARY PEERS TO VOTE IN THE LORDS.

WE WILL GREATLY STRENGTHEN THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. BRITISH GOVERNMENTS
HAVE SOUGHT TO LULL CITIZENS INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY BY CLAIMING THAT
OUR RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED BY AN UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION. HUNDREDS OF BRITISH
PEOPLE FIND OUT EVERY YEAR THAT THESE PROTECTIONS ARE INADEQUATE AND THEY
HAVE TO GO TO STRASBOURG TO SEEK PROTECTION FROM THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON
HUMAN RIGHTS. WE WILL ENACT THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION INTO BRITISH LAW, SO
THAT THE CITIZEN CAN SECURE REDRESS IN THE BRITISH COURTS.

WE WILL ESTABLISH A HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, WHICH WILL TAKE OVER THE WORK
OF THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND RACIAL EQUALITY COMMISSIONS, AND COUNTER ALL
DISCRIMINATION ON GROUNDS OF RACE, SEX, CREED, CLASS, DISABILITY OR SEXUAL
ORIENTATION. THE COMMISSION WOULD BE ABLE TO INITIATE ACTION IN THE COURTS.

WE WILL OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AT WORK AND IN PUBLIC LIFE. TODAY,
FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE OF GOVERNMENT APPOINTEES ON PUBLIC BODIES ARE WOMEN.
WE WILL SECURE EQUAL REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN ON ALL APPOINTED PUBLIC BODIES
WITHIN A DECADE; OUR SOCIAL AND TAX POLICIES AIM TO GIVE WOMEN EQUAL RIGHTS
AND FREEDOM TO CHOOSE THEIR WAY OF LIFE.

THE ALLIANCE ACCEPTS THE NEED FOR IMMIGRATION CONTROLS AND FOR CLEAR LEGAL
DEFINITION OF BRITISH NATIONALITY, BUT ALSO ACCEPTS THAT THE LAW IN THIS
AREA IS FUNDAMENTAL TO INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND SHOULD BE FAIR TO EVERYONE
REGARDLESS OF RACE AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE MEN OR WOMEN. THERE
SHOULD BE EFFECTIVE RIGHTS OF APPEAL AGAINST REFUSAL OF CITIZENSHIP AND
REFERRAL TO AN INDEPENDENT BODY IN CASES OF DEPORTATION, AND IMMIGRATION
PROCEDURES SHOULD BE REVISED SO AS TO PROMOTE FAMILY UNITY WITHOUT
SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTING IMMIGRATION TOTALS, WHICH REMAIN LOWER THAN RATES OF
EMIGRATION FROM BRITAIN.

WE WILL COMBAT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE IN HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT
AND TAKE POSITIVE STEPS THROUGH SUCH MEASURES AS CONTRACT COMPLIANCE TO
SECURE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR RACIAL MINORITIES, AND WE WILL DEVOTE MORE
POLICE RESOURCES TO DEALING WITH RACIAL HARASSMENT.

WE WILL COMBAT PREJUDICE AGAINST AND MISUNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE WITH
DISABILITIES, TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE, AND TO EXTEND EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISABLED YOUNG PEOPLE.

WE WILL RESTORE THE PRINCIPLE THAT ANYONE BORN IN BRITAIN IS ENTITLED TO
BRITISH CITIZENSHIP. WE ARE ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO DISCRIMINATION AND WE WILL
REPEAL THE SEXIST AND RACIST ASPECTS OF THE BRITISH NATIONALITY ACT 1981.

THE GREAT REFORM CHARTER

DEMOCRACY IN BRITAIN DID NOT JUST HAPPEN. IT WAS THE PRODUCT OF REFORM -
REFORM AGAINST VESTED INTERESTS OF BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT. IN 1832 BRITAIN TOOK
THE FIRST STEP WITH THE GREAT REFORM ACT. FURTHER INSTALMENTS OF REFORM
FOLLOWED IN 1867, 1884, 1918 AND 1928 BEFORE ALL MEN AND WOMEN HAD GAINED
THE VOTE. YET, SINCE THEN, OUR DEMOCRACY HAS STOOD STILL DESPITE THE
TREMENDOUS CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. THE ALLIANCE BELIEVES THAT IT
IS TIME FOR A NEW ERA OF REFORM. FOR, WITHOUT GETTING THE STRUCTURE OF OUR
DEMOCRACY RIGHT, WE WILL GET NOTHING RIGHT.

THE ALLIANCE, IF EMPOWERED BY THE BRITISH PEOPLE, WILL:

   * REPLACE THE UNDEMOCRATIC 'FIRST PAST THE POST' ELECTORAL SYSTEM WITH
     PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION BASED ON A SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE FOR ALL
     WESTMINSTER AND LOCAL AUTHORITY ELECTIONS;
   * INTRODUCE PR FOR ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. WE SUPPORT A
     COMMON SYSTEM FOR ALL MEMBER STATES;
   * REPEAL THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT AND REPLACE IT WITH FREEDOM OF
     INFORMATION LEGISLATION PROVIDING FOR A PUBLIC RIGHT OF ACCESS TO ALL
     OFFICIAL INFORMATION, SUBJECT TO LIMITED AND SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS TO
     PROTECT NATIONAL SECURITY AND PROPER LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PRIVACY;
   * REFORM THE LAW OF CONFIDENTIALITY TO ENSURE THAT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
     ON MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST IS NOT UNNECESSARILY RESTRICTED;
   * INCORPORATE THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND ITS PROTOCOLS
     INTO BRITISH LAW IN A BILL OF RIGHTS;
   * REMOVE THE RIGHT OF THE PRIME MINISTER TO DETERMINE THE DATE OF GENERAL
     ELECTIONS AND REPLACE IT WITH FIXED-TERM PARLIAMENTS;
   * DEVOLVE POWER TO A LEGISLATIVE SCOTTISH ASSEMBLY, ESTABLISH A WELSH
     SENEDD AND DECENTRALISE DECISION-MAKING TO THE ENGLISH REGIONS IN
     ACCORDANCE WITH THE WISHES OF THEIR ELECTORS;
   * EXTENSIVELY REFORM WHITEHALL PROCEDURES IN ORDER TO MAKE THE
     GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE WISHES AND NEEDS OF THE
     PEOPLE;
   * REFORM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS PROCEDURES;
   * REFORM THE HOUSE OF LORDS.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN

THE ALLIANCE IS COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLE THAT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE EQUAL
OPPORTUNITIES AND IN GOVERNMENT WE WILL TAKE POSITIVE STEPS TO ENSURE THIS
IDEAL BECOMES A REALITY.

WE WILL OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN IN PUBLIC LIFE BY SECURING EQUAL
REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN ON ALL APPOINTED BODIES WITHIN A DECADE.

WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AT WORK THROUGH EQUAL PAY FOR WORK OF
EQUAL VALUE, EQUAL TREATMENT, ENSURING THAT ALL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND
PRIVATE CONTRACTORS ARE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYERS. WE WILL RESTORE THE
MATERNITY GRANT AND IMPROVE BENEFITS FOR FAMILIES.

WE WILL OFFER A TAX ALLOWANCE TO HELP WITH THE COSTS OF CHILDCARE AND REMOVE
THE TAX ON THE USE OF WORKPLACE NURSERIES.

WE WILL ENSURE THAT GIRLS AND WOMEN HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN EDUCATION
AND TRAINING.

WE WILL PROMOTE MEASURES THAT GIVE EMPLOYEES WITH FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES
RIGHTS TO PARENTAL AND FAMILY LEAVE.

THE ALLIANCE WANTS TO SEE MORE WOMEN IN WESTMINSTER. CHANGING THE ELECTORAL
SYSTEM TO A FORM OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WILL INCREASE THE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN TO BE ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT.

NORTHERN IRELAND

WE INTEND TO SECURE PROGRESS TOWARDS A PEACEFUL AND SECURE LIFE FOR THE
PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND. THAT DEPENDS ON THE ACCEPTANCE OF THREE
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES:

   * REJECTION OF VIOLENCE;
   * RECOGNITION THAT BOTH UNIONIST AND NATIONALIST TRADITIONS HAVE THEIR
     LEGITIMATE PLACE;
   * ACCEPTANCE THAT NORTHERN IRELAND SHOULD NOT CEASE TO BE A PART OF THE
     UK UNLESS A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND SO WISH.

THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND MUST BE BASED ON A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN
THE TWO TRADITIONS. THE ALLIANCE WELCOMES THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT AS A
GENUINE ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES WE SET OUT. WE WISH TO SEE A
UK/IRISH PARLIAMENTARY COUNCIL, AND A DEVOLVED ASSEMBLY WHERE
RESPONSIBILITIES AND POWER WILL BE SHARED. WE WOULD IMPROVE ARRANGEMENTS FAR
CONSIDERING NORTHERN IRELAND LEGISLATION AT WESTMINSTER.

OUR COMMITMENT TO INCORPORATE THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS INTO
UK LAW WILL STRENGTHEN INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND WE WOULD
REFORM THE DIPLOCK COURTS SO THAT THREE JUDGES PRESIDE OVER NON-JURY TRIALS;
IN THIS AND OTHER RESPECTS WE BELIEVE THAT THE PASSING OF IDENTICAL
ANTI-TERRORIST MEASURES IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE REPUBLIC CAN INCREASE
THE AUTHORITY THOSE MEASURES CARRY IN A DIVIDED COMMUNITY. WE ALSO SUPPORT
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT SECURITY COMMISSION.

WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE PARTICIPATION OF PEOPLE FROM THE MINORITY TRADITION
IN THE RUC AND BELIEVE THAT A TOTALLY INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS
PROCEDURE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. WE WOULD INTRODUCE THE 110-DAY LIMIT ON THE
TIME IN WHICH A PRISONER MAY BE HELD IN CUSTODY BEFORE APPEARING IN COURT,
AS WE PROPOSE FOR ENGLAND AND WALES.

WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE WORKING FOR RECONCILIATION IN NORTHERN
IRELAND AND WHO ARE SEEKING TO ELIMINATE SECTARIANISM AND DISCRIMINATION IN
RELIGIOUS LIFE, EDUCATION, HOUSING AND POLITICS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE EEC OFFERS NOT ONLY PRACTICAL HELP TO
NORTHERN IRELAND, BUT ALSO PROSPECTS FOR THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF A
CONFEDERAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UK AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND WHICH COULD
OFFER A SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM WHICH HAS CLAIMED OVER 2,500 LIVES IN THE LAST
18 YEARS.

FIGHTING CRIME

CRIME RATES HAVE SOARED IN THIS GOVERNMENT'S LAST EIGHT YEARS. OVERALL,
CRIME IS UP BY OVER 60%, BURGLARIES HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED, WHILE ROBBERIES
HAVE INCREASED TWO AND A HALF TIMES OVER. PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY ELDERLY
PEOPLE, LIVE IN FEAR IN THEIR HOMES AND IN THE STREETS AND WOMEN FEEL
INCREASINGLY UNABLE TO GO OUT AT NIGHT.

DETECTION RATES HAVE DROPPED FROM OVER TWO-FIFTHS IN 1979 TO UNDER A THIRD
IN 1986. INCREASES IN POLICE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN LARGELY OFFSET BY SPECIAL
DUTIES LIKE POLICING STRIKES AND DEMONSTRATIONS, AND BY A DROP IN THE
WORKING WEEK. THERE ARE FEW EXTRA BOBBIES ON THE BEAT.

THE ALLIANCE WOULD TACKLE BOTH CRIME AND THE CAUSES OF CRIME. SOME
LABOUR-CONTROLLED BOROUGHS REFUSE TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE POLICE IN COMBATING
CRIME. THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO RECOGNISE THAT HOMELESSNESS,
UNEMPLOYMENT AND AIMLESS BED-AND-BREAKFAST REGIMES ARE BREEDING-GROUNDS OF
DELINQUENCY. BOTH ARE WRONG.

THE POLICE

THE ALLIANCE FIRMLY SUPPORTS THE POLICE IN THE BATTLE AGAINST CRIME; THAT
LIGHT CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVE IF THE POLICE GET THE SUPPORT OF THE WHOLE
COMMUNITY, THROUGH COMMUNITY POLICING AND POLICEMEN ON THE BEAT. MANY POLICE
FORCES ARE STILL UNDER STRENGTH: YET MORE OFFICERS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE
KIND OF LOCAL POLICING WHICH WE BELIEVE IS ESSENTIAL. AN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT
WILL FINANCE A FURTHER 4,000 POLICE OFFICERS OVER AND ABOVE THE PRESENT
GOVERNMENT PLANS AND 1,000 MORE CIVILIANS, SO RELEASING POLICE OFFICERS FOR
PATROL DUTIES.

PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD STOP UNREPRESENTATIVE
EXTREMISTS FROM CONTROLLING POLICE AUTHORITIES. IT WOULD MEAN MORE SENSIBLE
POLICE AUTHORITIES AND MAKE POSSIBLE A DEMOCRATICALLY ACCOUNTABLE POLICE
AUTHORITY FOR LONDON. WE OPPOSE THE POLICE MONITORING UNITS BY WHICH SOME
LABOUR COUNCILS ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE THE POLICE. THE ALLIANCE FULLY ACCEPTS
THE NEED FOR CHIEF OFFICERS TO HAVE FULL OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THEIR FORCE.
THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTS A FULLY INDEPENDENT SYSTEM FOR INVESTIGATING
COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE POLICE. WE REJECT MOVES TOWARDS A NATIONAL POLICE
FORCE. WE WOULD APPOINT A ROYAL COMMISSION TO REVIEW THE QUESTION OF POLICE
ACCOUNTABILITY.

UPHOLDING THE LAW

WE WILL CREATE A NEW MINISTRY OF JUSTICE. ITS RESPONSIBILITIES WILL INCLUDE
THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RIGHTS OF THE CITIZEN TO LEGAL AID AND ADVICE AND
IMPROVING COURT AND TRIBUNAL PROCEDURES. WE WILL ESTABLISH A FAMILY COURT
SYSTEM AND SET UP A NEW LEGAL SERVICES COUNCIL.

SENTENCING POLICY. SENTENCING IS OFTEN SEEN AS ARBITRARY, WITH THE SAME
CRIME ATTRACTING WIDELY DIVERGENT PUNISHMENTS. FOR THE CRIMINALS, SENTENCES
BECOME MORE OF A LOTTERY THAN A DETERRING FORCE. WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE ROLE
OF THE JUDICIAL STUDIES BOARD IN SETTING GUIDELINES FOR SENTENCING. THIS
WILL MEAN THAT ANY JUDGE STEPPING OUTSIDE THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD
BE ASKED TO EXPLAIN THE REASON AND ANY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS WOULD
MAINTAIN A JUDGE'S FLEXIBILITY, WHILE KEEPING SENTENCING BROADLY CONSISTENT.
IT WOULD ALSO LIMIT THE EVER-INCREASING UPWARD TREND IN SENTENCING.

A ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE PRESENTATION OF VIOLENCE IN THE MEDIA. WE WILL
ESTABLISH A ROYAL COMMISSION TO REPORT WITHIN A YEAR ON THE PUBLIC
PRESENTATION OF VIOLENCE ON TV AND THE REPORTING OF CRIME IN NEWSPAPERS, TO
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN THESE AND VIOLENT CRIME ON
THE STREETS.

CRIME PREVENTION UNITS. THERE WOULD BE A DUTY ON ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO
ESTABLISH CRIME PREVENTION UNITS, AND TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE POLICE TO
HELP IN SETTING UP NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH SCHEMES. THEY WOULD ADVISE ON
SECURITY IN ALL NEW PLANNING AND BUILDING.

INSURING AGAINST CRIME. WE AIM TO MAKE INSURANCE AVAILABLE TO ALL COUNCIL
TENANTS, WHO ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE BURGLED AS HOME OWNERS AND FAR LESS
LIKELY TO BE INSURED.

CURBING THE SALE OF OFFENSIVE WEAPONS. WE WILL CURB THE SALE OF KNUCKLE
DUSTERS, BATTLE KNIVES, SPIKED SHOE STRAPS, CROSS-BOWS AND CATAPULTS.

LIFELINE

TOO MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM ISOLATION, FEAR AND COLD.

WE INTEND TO GIVE THEM THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND WARMTH THEY DESERVE. BRITAIN
HAS 6 MILLION PEOPLE AGED 70 OR OVER. FOR THEM OUR "LIFELINE" PROGRAMME
WILL:-

   * INCLUDE FREE INSTALLATION OF A TELEPHONE;
   * PROTECT THEM AGAINST THE CRIMINAL BY FREE INSTALLATION OF SECURE LOCKS:
   * CUT THEIR HEATING BILLS BY FREE HOME INSULATION;
   * ABOLISH STANDING CHARGES ON ELECTRICITY. GAS AND TELEPHONES;

THESE 6 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN 4.5 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS AND THIS WILL COST
£180 MILLION. "LIFELINE" WILL BUILD ON PRESENT SCHEMES AND WILL ALSO BE PART
OF OUR LONG-TERM JOB GUARANTEE.

CRIME CRISIS AREAS

AN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT WILL TARGET "CRIME CRISIS AREAS", THOSE WITH THE
HIGHEST RATES OF CRIME, FOR SPECIAL ANTI-CRIME MEASURES. CHIEF CONSTABLES,
IN CONSULTATION WITH COMMUNITY/POLICE LIAISON COMMITTEES AND POLICE
AUTHORITIES, WOULD DEFINE THESE AREAS. THEY WILL HAVE:-

   * MORE POLICE ON THE STREETS;
   * LOCAL POLICE STATIONS RE-OPENED. POLICE POSTS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED
     WHERE NO STATION IS CLOSE BY;
   * SECURITY GRANTS TO PAY FOR ENTRY PHONES AND SECURITY LOCKS;
   * PROJECTS TO MAKE CRIME DANGER SPOTS SAFE AND TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE
     STREET LIGHTING AND MORE CARETAKERS ON ESTATES;
   * NEW HOUSING ESTATES DESIGNED TO MINIMISE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CRIME, AND
     HAZARDOUS PUBLIC AREAS WILL BE REDESIGNED;
   * A LEGAL OBLIGATION IMPOSED ON BRITISH TELECOM TO KEEP ALL PUBLIC
     TELEPHONES IN CONSTANT REPAIR. IN LONDON UP TO HALF OUR PUBLIC
     TELEPHONES ARE BROKEN AT ANY ONE TIME - MANY OF THEM THE ONLY LIFELINE
     IN HIGH CRIME AREAS.

DEALING WITH OFFENDERS

THE PRISON SCANDAL

THE PRISONS ARE BURSTING AT THE SEAMS, YET HOME OFFICE PROJECTIONS SHOW
NUMBERS INCREASING UNTIL THE END OF THE DECADE 1985-1995. OF THE 13,000
INCREASE, 5,000 PEOPLE WILL BE UNTRIED AND UNSENTENCED.

THE ALLIANCE BELIEVES DRASTIC ACTION IS NEEDED TO REDUCE THE PRISON
POPULATION, WHILE ENSURING THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR VIOLENT AND SERIOUS
CRIME ARE KEPT OUT OF SOCIETY FOR AS LONG AS THE COURTS THINK NECESSARY.
IMPRISONMENT RARELY REHABILITATES THE PRISONER. THREE-FIFTHS OF ALL MEN WHO
RECEIVE A PRISON SENTENCE RE-OFFEND WITHIN TWO YEARS OF BEING RELEASED.

THE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR PRISONS PROPOSED BY NACRO, AND ACCEPTED IN
PRINCIPLE BY THE THEN HOME SECRETARY AS LONG AGO AS 1981, SHOULD BE ADOPTED
AS A TARGET TO BE ACHIEVED WITHIN TWO YEARS.

A LIMIT OF 110 DAYS SHOULD BE LAID DOWN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR REMAND
PRISONERS. IF NOT PROSECUTED WITHIN THAT PERIOD, THEY WOULD BE RELEASED.
THIS SYSTEM OPERATES SUCCESSFULLY IN SCOTLAND.

PROBATION AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE BAIL HOSTELS ADEQUATE TO
ACCOMMODATE THEIR OWN NEEDS. THE HOME OFFICE SHOULD MAKE A SPECIAL 100%
GRANT FOR THE PURPOSE.

THE 'SHORT, SHARP, SHOCK' HAS FAILED. AS THE MAGISTRATE'S ASSOCIATION HAS
RECOMMENDED THERE SHOULD BE A SINGLE YOUTH CUSTODY SENTENCE. DETENTION
CENTRES, ALREADY UNDER-USED BY THE COURTS, SHOULD BE ABOLISHED, AND THE
ACCOMMODATION RELEASED TO BE USED FOR REMAND CENTRES.

ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON

EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT FINE DEFAULTERS, ELDERLY
SHOPLIFTERS AND DRUNKS ARE NOT SENT TO PRISON.

POLICE CAUTIONS AND INTERMEDIATE TREATMENT SHOULD BE MORE WIDELY USED. WHERE
PUNISHMENT IS APPROPRIATE, IT SHOULD NORMALLY BE COMMUNITY SERVICE RATHER
THAN PRISON; BUT MANY OF THESE OFFENDERS ARE MORE APPROPRIATELY DEALT WITH
BY REHABILITATION OR MEDICAL TREATMENT.

THE PROBATION SERVICE MUST BE EXPANDED TO ENABLE BAIL AND NON CUSTODIAL
SENTENCES TO BE SUPERVISED WHERE NECESSARY UNDER APPROPRIATE SUPERVISION.

THE HOME OFFICE SHOULD CONSIDER EXTENDING THE PERIOD OF AUTOMATIC REMISSION
FOR LESS SERIOUS OFFENCES.

WE STRONGLY SUPPORT VICTIM SUPPORT SCHEMES.

OFFENDERS SHOULD RECOMPENSE THEIR VICTIMS, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.
COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS OBLIGE OFFENDERS TO UNDERTAKE WORK FOR THE
COMMUNITY. THEY SHOULD BE MORE WIDELY USED.

THESE CHANGES SHOULD EASE THE FRUSTRATION THAT THREATENS TO ERUPT IN THE
PRISONS, AND ENABLE PRISON OFFICERS TO DO THE PROFESSIONAL JOB THEY WANT TO
DO. WE WELCOME 'FRESH START', WHICH PROPOSES SHORTER HOURS AND LESS RELIANCE
ON OVERTIME, BUT RECOGNISE THAT UNLESS OVERCROWDING IS TACKLED, THIS REFORM
MAY NOT WORK.

BUILDING THE FUTURE

A GENERATION AGO, BRITAIN WAS AMONG EUROPE'S RICHEST COUNTRIES. TODAY
BRITAIN IS FALLING DOWN THE LEAGUE OF INDUSTRIALISED NATIONS. REAL INCOME
PER HEAD IS WELL BELOW THAT OF SWEDEN, GERMANY OR FRANCE. OUR MANUFACTURING
TRADE HAS GONE INTO THE RED. IN EVERY YEAR SINCE 1983 WE HAVE IMPORTED MORE
GOODS THAN WE EXPORTED, THE FIRST TIME THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.

WORST OF ALL IS UNEMPLOYMENT. MANY MORE THAN THE THREE MILLION PEOPLE
REGISTERED AS UNEMPLOYED HAVE NO JOBS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS JUGGLED THE
FIGURES AND BROUGHT IN COSMETIC DEVICES TO HIDE THE TRUTH. BUT THE FACTS
WON'T GO AWAY. THE DOLE QUEUE IS THREE TIMES WHAT IT WAS IN 1979.
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN A LOW PRIORITY FOR THIS GOVERNMENT, USED TO KEEP DOWN
INFLATION. TAX CUTS HAVE HAD A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN JOB CREATION. THE COST
IN HUMAN MISERY AND HARDSHIP, LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AND SELF-RESPECT, NOT LEAST
AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. HAS BEEN INCALCULABLE.

BRITAIN, LIKE OTHER INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES, HAS TO CROSS THE GULF BETWEEN THE
FIRST INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, BASED ON STEEL, ENGINEERING AND RAILWAYS, AND
THE SECOND, BASED ON THE SUNRISE TECHNOLOGIES OF MICRO-ELECTRONICS,
BIO-TECHNOLOGY AND NEW MATERIALS. TO CROSS THAT GULF DEMANDS INVESTMENT IN
NEW BUILDINGS, PLANT AND MACHINERY, AND ABOVE ALL N THE RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT ON WHICH NEW PRODUCTS AND NEW PROCESSES ARE BASED. YET UNDER
MRS. THATCHER'S GOVERNMENT, INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY AND IN R &
D HAS FALLEN SUBSTANTIALLY. WE MUST GIVE A MUCH HIGHER PRIORITY TO TRAINING
AND EDUCATION. THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE DECLINE IN APPRENTICESHIPS AND SKILL
TRAINING IN BRITAIN IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, ALTHOUGH THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES
DEMAND MUCH HIGHER QUALIFICATIONS AND REGULAR UPDATING OF KNOWLEDGE.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO USE THE ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY NORTH
SEA OIL GAVE US TO INVEST IN OUR INDUSTRY AND IN OUR PEOPLE. HIGH INTEREST
RATES HAVE CRIPPLED BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES; SUDDEN UPS AND DOWNS IN THE
STERLING EXCHANGE RATE HAVE HANDICAPPED EXPORTS. EVEN THE PROCEEDS FROM
SELLING-OFF STATE ASSETS - OUR ASSETS - HAVE GONE INTO CUTTING TAXES TO BUY
VOTES.

THESE ARE OUR OBJECTIVES:

   * TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT, FIRST AMONGST THOSE UNEMPLOYED FOR A YEAR OR
     MORE, AND AMONGST YOUNG PEOPLE; IN THREE YEARS WE WILL REDUCE
     UNEMPLOYMENT BY ONE MILLION;
   * TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE OLDER INDUSTRIAL AREAS AND THE AREAS OF
     PROSPERITY. THE OLDER INDUSTRIAL AREAS HAVE LOST A MILLION JOBS. WE
     WOULD ENCOURAGE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND LOCAL EMPLOYMENT
     INITIATIVES TO HARNESS THE ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE IN
     THESE HARD-HIT AREAS. THE SOUTH-EAST WOULD BENEFIT TOO, FOR HOUSE
     PRICES ARE NOW SNARING FAR BEYOND THE ABILITY OF MOST FAMILIES TO PAY,
     AND ATTRACTIVE COUNTRYSIDE IS BESIEGED BY DEVELOPERS;
   * TO BUILD A NEW PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT, TO RE-EQUIP
     OUR FACTORIES, TACKLE THE BLIGHT OF OUR INNER CITIES, AND DRAW UP A
     STRATEGY FOR A COMPETITIVE AND SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRY;
   * TO ABOLISH CLASS DIVISION IN THE WORKPLACE BY ENCOURAGING A SINGLE
     STATUS FOR WHITE COLLAR AND BLUE COLLAR WORKERS, AND CREATING
     OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL EMPLOYEES TO SHARE IN THE PROFITS, DECISIONS AND
     OWNERSHIP OF FIRMS;
   * TO STRENGTHEN THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AT WORK INCLUDING EQUAL PAY FOR WORK
     OF EQUAL VALUE AND EQUAL TREATMENT. WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL PUBLIC
     AUTHORITIES AND PRIVATE CONTRACTORS ARE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYERS AND
     WE WILL PROMOTE CHANGES TO ENABLE THOSE WITH DOMESTIC RESPONSIBILITIES
     TO SECURE ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT. WE WOULD RESTORE MATERNITY GRANTS AND
     GIVE A TAX ALLOWANCE TO HELP WITH CHILD-CARE COSTS. WE WOULD REMOVE THE
     TAX ON THE USE OF WORKPLACE NURSERIES AND ENCOURAGE WIDER PROVISION OF
     CHILD-CARE FACILITIES.

UNEMPLOYMENT

UNEMPLOYMENT AT PRESENT LEVELS IS NOT THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF NEW
TECHNOLOGY OR WORLD RECESSION - JAPAN HAS ONLY 2.5% UNEMPLOYMENT AND US
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN BY TWO MILLION SINCE 1983. IT CAN BE REDUCED IN
BRITAIN. THE KEY IS TO ENSURE THAT IN CREATING NEW JOBS THE NATION DOES NOT
EMBARK ON ANOTHER ROUND OF SEVERE INFLATION WHICH WILL DAMAGE
COMPETITIVENESS AND COST US JOBS IN THE LONG RUN. LABOUR IGNORES THIS DANGER
AND THE CONSERVATIVES USE IT AS AN EXCUSE FOR ALLOWING UNEMPLOYMENT TO
REMAIN HIGH. THE ALLIANCE IS PREPARED TO TAKE THE DIFFICULT STEPS NECESSARY
TO CREATE JOBS AND CONTROL INFLATION AT THE SAME TIME.

THEREFORE WE WILL EXPAND THE ECONOMY BY TARGETING RESOURCES TO INCREASE
OUTPUT AND EXPORTS RATHER THAN CONSUMPTION AND IMPORTS. NEW CAPITAL
INVESTMENT BUILDING UP TO £1.5 BILLION PER ANNUM WILL SUPPORT THE FRAMEWORK
OF SERVICES ON WHICH INDUSTRY AND SOCIETY DEPEND, LIKE TRANSPORT, HOMES,
SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS AND DRAINAGE. WE WILL GIVE MORE SPENDING POWER TO THE
POOREST PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY, WHICH WILL ITSELF GENERATE MORE ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY WITH MUCH LESS IMPACT ON IMPORTS THAN GENERAL CUTS IN INCOME TAX;

WE WILL CONTROL INFLATION BY WINNING THE SUPPORT OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE FOR
OUR INCOMES STRATEGY; AS A BACK-UP WE WILL LEGISLATE FOR RESERVE POWERS FOR
A COUNTER-INFLATION TAX ON COMPANIES UNDER WHICH INFLATIONARY INCREASES
WOULD BE UNATTRACTIVE BECAUSE THEY WOULD GO IN EXTRA TAX: PROFIT-SHARING
WOULD BE EXEMPTED. WE WOULD INTRODUCE FAIRER ARRANGEMENTS FOR PUBLIC SECTOR
PAY, WITH AN INDEPENDENT PAY AND INFORMATION BOARD WHOSE FINDINGS WOULD
INFORM AND ASSIST NEGOTIATIONS, ARBITRATION PROCEDURES AND INCENTIVES TO
NEGOTIATE NO-STRIKE AGREEMENTS IN ESSENTIAL SERVICES;

WE WILL JOIN THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM OF THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM,
ENABLING US TO MAKE OUR CURRENCY MORE STABLE AND TO REDUCE CURRENT INTEREST
RATES BY AS MUCH AS 2%. WE WOULD ALSO SEEK TO DEVELOP THE ROLE OF THE EMS
WITHIN THE WORLD ECONOMY.

FOR THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED WE WILL PROVIDE A GUARANTEE OF A JOB THROUGH:

   * A) A BUILDING AND INVESTMENT PROGRAMME AIMED AT PROVIDING 200,000 JOBS
     IN SUCH ESSENTIAL AREAS AS TRANSPORT, HOUSING, INSULATION, URBAN
     RENEWAL AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES;
   * B) A NEW RECRUITMENT INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO TAKE ON OVER
     270,000 JOBLESS PEOPLE;
   * C) A CRASH PROGRAMME OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING, OFFERING NEW SKILLS TO
     THE UNSKILLED UNEMPLOYED, WITH 200,000 PLACES;
   * D) 60,000 EXTRA JOBS IN THE HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES TO IMPROVE CARE
     IN THE COMMUNITY AND MORE JOBS IN NURSERY EDUCATION;
   * E) AN EXPANDED JOB RELEASE SCHEME, OPENING UP 30,000 JOBS BY ALLOWING
     MEN TO BENEFIT FROM THE SCHEME AT 62 YEARS OF AGE.

REBUILDING BRITISH INDUSTRY

MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES GO HAND IN HAND, BUT ONLY A QUARTER OF SERVICES
ARE TRADABLE AND TWO THIRDS OF OUR EXPORTS DEPEND ON MANUFACTURING. BRITAIN
CANNOT SURVIVE ON A BASIS OF LOW-TECH SERVICE JOBS. NOR CAN BUSINESS
FLOURISH WITHOUT A THRIVING INDUSTRY TO BUY THEIR PRODUCTS. MANUFACTURING
INDUSTRY IS THE DRIVING FORCE AT THE CORE OF OUR ECONOMY. ITS DECLINE MUST
BE REVERSED.

THEREFORE:

   * WE WILL INTRODUCE INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT BONDS TO ATTRACT INVESTORS INTO
     INDUSTRY, A NEW INDUSTRIAL CREDIT SCHEME TO PROVIDE MEDIUM-TERM FINANCE
     FOR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES AND A TAX ALLOWANCE FOR INVESTMENT IN NEW
     TECHNOLOGIES;
   * WE WILL WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY AND PUT INDUSTRY FIRST. THERE
     WILL BE A NEW CABINET INDUSTRIAL POLICY COMMITTEE RESPONSIBLE FOR
     OVERSEEING THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION, IN CO-OPERATION WITH
     INDUSTRY, OF A BROAD INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY WITH LONG-TERM PRIORITIES;
   * WE WILL ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO TAKE ON MORE STAFF BY A 25% CUT IN THEIR
     NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTION PAYMENTS TARGETED ON ASSISTED AREAS AND
     AREAS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT;
   * WE WILL INTRODUCE A TRAINING INCENTIVE WITH REBATES FOR COMPANIES WHO
     SPEND MORE MONEY ON TRAINING AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THOSE WHO DO NOT
     PROVIDE IT THEMSELVES; OUR NEW DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING
     WILL MONITOR STANDARDS AND TURN YOUTH TRAINING INTO A FULLY
     COMPREHENSIVE, HIGH QUALITY VOCATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR
     16-19 YEARS OLD;
   * WE WILL INCREASE THE LAMENTABLY LOW FUNDING OF CIVIL RESEARCH AND
     DEVELOPMENT, PLACING EMPHASIS BOTH ON COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION OF NEW
     TECHNOLOGY USING THE BRITISH TECHNOLOGY GROUP, AND ON BOOSTING BASIC
     SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH; WE WOULD GIVE GREATER SUPPORT TO EUROPEAN
     COMMUNITY JOINT RESEARCH PROGRAMMES;
   * WE WILL GIVE MORE BACKING TO EXPORTS USING THE EXPORT CREDIT GUARANTEE
     DEPARTMENT AND THE AID AND TRADE PROVISION (FUNDED FROM THE DTI) MORE
     EFFECTIVELY THAN THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAS DONE IN RECENT YEARS
     BECAUSE OF ITS AMBIVALENT ATTITUDE TOWARDS PUBLIC SECTOR SUPPORT. WE
     WILL PRESS THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY TO TAKE STERN ACTION AGAINST DUMPING.
     WE WILL LAUNCH A MORE DETERMINED ATTACK ON UNFAIR RESTRICTIONS ON OUR
     TRADE, INCLUDING THOSE IMPOSED BY JAPAN ON A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND
     SERVICES AND BY THE US ON OUR HIGH-TECHNOLOGY EXPORTS;
   * WE WILL INSIST ON A STRONG COMPETITION POLICY TO PROMOTE EFFICIENCY AND
     GIVE CONSUMERS A FAIR DEAL: THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING WILL BE
     STRENGTHENED AND WILL TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MONOPOLIES
     AND MERGERS COMMISSION AND COMPANIES SEEKING MERGERS WILL HAVE TO
     JUSTIFY THEM; INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS WILL HAVE POWER TO SEEK
     REDRESS IN COURT AGAINST ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES;
   * WE WILL CONTINUE TO JUDGE WHETHER INDUSTRIES SHOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC OR
     PRIVATE SECTOR ON OBJECTIVE CRITERIA RELATED TO COMPETITION AND
     EFFICIENCY. WE OPPOSED THE PRIVATISATION OF BRITISH GAS AND BRITISH
     TELECOM ALTHOUGH WE WOULD NOT REVERSE IT BUT INSTEAD CONCENTRATE ON
     IMPROVING CONSUMER CHOICE AND PROTECTION. WE SUPPORTED THE
     PRIVATISATION OF ROLLS ROYCE. WE WOULD NOT PRIVATISE WATER AUTHORITIES
     AND THE CENTRAL ELECTRICITY GENERATING BOARD ON GROUNDS OF PUBLIC
     POLICY RELATING TO SAFETY STANDARDS AND CARE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. WE
     WELCOME THE FACT THAT BRITISH STEEL IS NOW OPERATING PROFITABLY. WE
     BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE RETAINED AS A SINGLE ENTITY TO WITHSTAND
     INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR PRIVATISATION
     PROVIDING ITS SUCCESS CAN BE MAINTAINED;
   * WE WILL WORK WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE HARD-HIT REGIONS TO STIMULATE NEW
     ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND NEW PROSPECTS FOR JOBS THROUGH REGIONAL
     DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE SETTING UP OF A LOCAL
     VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS TO FINANCE NEW ENTERPRISE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
     GOVERNMENT ALWAYS KNOWS BEST, SO WE WILL SUPPORT LOCAL INITIATIVES
     THROUGH APPROPRIATE FISCAL AND FINANCIAL MEANS.

BACKING SMALL BUSINESS

WE WILL BUILD A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT, ENTREPRENEURS AND INVESTORS
TO ENCOURAGE NEW BUSINESSES AND CREATE NEW JOBS. WE WILL ESPECIALLY
ENCOURAGE SMALL BUSINESSES, WHICH WILL BE A MAJOR MOTOR OF GROWTH AND
EMPLOYMENT IN THE 1990S.

WE WILL REDUCE THE TAX AND ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON SMALL BUSINESSES.

WE WILL PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SMALL FIRMS INVESTMENT COMPANIES TO
PROVIDE EQUITY AND LOAN FINANCE.

WE WILL INTRODUCE A BILL TO ENABLE BUSINESS TO CHARGE INTEREST ON OVERDUE
PAYMENT OF BILLS, IF THEY SO WISH.

WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE BUSINESS START-UP SCHEMES AND EXPANSION
SCHEMES SPECIFICALLY GEARED TO ENCOURAGING ENTERPRISE BY WOMEN.

WE WILL ENSURE SMALL BUSINESSES GET THEIR FAIR SHARE OF PUBLIC CONTRACTS
FROM BOTH CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE LOCAL PUBLIC/PRIVATE INITIATIVES, SUCH AS THE ENTERPRISE
AGENCIES, WHICH WE IDENTIFIED IN OUR WORKSEARCH CAMPAIGN.

INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT BONDS

WE WILL INTRODUCE INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT BONDS TO LIBERATE MANY NEW AND SMALL
BUSINESSES FROM THE HIGH COST OF BORROWING START-UP CAPITAL.

THESE BONDS WILL HELP BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE NEW BUSINESSMAN WHO NEEDS
ACCESS TO LOW-COST FUNDS AND THE INVESTOR, INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS, WHO WOULD
LIKE TO BACK HIM OR HER PROVIDED THE BALANCE BETWEEN RISK AND REWARD IS
REASONABLE. WE WILL ACCORDINGLY ALLOW NEW AND GROWING COMPANIES TO RAISE
FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUE OF INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT BONDS WHICH WILL PAY
INTEREST FREE OF TAX TO INVESTORS.

A SIMILAR SCHEME IS ALREADY PROVIDING A VALUABLE KICK-START FOR MANY NEW
COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES. TOGETHER WITH THE BUSINESS EXPANSION SCHEME,
OUR INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT BONDS WILL GIVE THE NEXT GENERATION OF BUSINESSES
THE MOST FAVOURABLE CLIMATE EVER TO BUILD UP EMPLOYMENT FOR THE COMMUNITY
AND PROFITS FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR INVESTORS.

WE WILL PROMOTE PARTNERSHIP

FOR TOO LONG THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR HAS BEEN A BATTLEGROUND BETWEEN OPPOSING
FORCES OF CAPITAL AND LABOUR, INSTEAD OF A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AND EQUAL
PARTNERSHIP.

WE WILL LEGISLATE FOR EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION BUT BELIEVE THAT FLEXIBILITY
MUST BE ALLOWED IN WORKING OUT THE DETAIL FOR EMPLOYEE COUNCILS AT THE PLACE
OF WORK. THESE COUNCILS SHOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION AND THE RIGHTS TO ENABLE
THEM TO CONTRIBUTE TO STRATEGIC DECISIONS; OPPORTUNITY MUST BE PROVIDED FOR
PARTICIPATION AT TOP LEVEL - FOR EXAMPLE BY EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS OR A
REPRESENTATIVE OR SUPERVISORY COUNCIL, OR BY DIRECTORS ELECTED BY
SHAREHOLDERS AND EMPLOYEES JOINTLY.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE OTHER FORMS OF INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION, INCLUDING
CO-OPERATIVES IN WHICH IT IS WORKERS WHO HIRE CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT SKILL;
WE WILL ESTABLISH AN INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIP AGENCY INCORPORATING THE
CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO TAKE A LEAD IN THIS FIELD.

WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE LAW IN RELATION TO DIRECTORS' STATUTORY OBLIGATION TO
HAVE REGARD TO THE INTERESTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS THEIR
SHAREHOLDERS; THIS SHOULD INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT TO CONSULT EMPLOYEES BEFORE
MAKING A RECOMMENDATION IN RESPONSE TO ANY TAKE-OVER BIDS.

WE WILL EXTEND INCENTIVES TO EMPLOYEES' SHARE-OWNERSHIP AND PROFIT-SHARING
WHICH WERE INTRODUCED AT LIBERAL INSISTENCE IN 1987.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE WIDER SHARE OWNERSHIP BY A SCHEME WHICH GIVES MORE PEOPLE
A DIRECT TAX INCENTIVE TO BECOME SMALL INVESTORS;

WE HAVE LONG BEEN COMMITTED TO TRADE UNION REFORM AIMED AT GIVING UNIONS
BACK TO THEIR MEMBERS AND WE HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD N PROMOTING THE EXTENSION
OF POSTAL BALLOTS AND INTERNAL ELECTIONS AND HAVE VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED
PRE-ENTRY CLOSED SHOPS. TRADES UNIONS ARE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THE
PROTECTION OF THE EMPLOYEES' INTERESTS, WHICH IS WHY WE WOULD RETURN UNION
RECOGNITION TO GCHQ MEMBERS. OUR CENTRAL AIM IS TO MAKE UNIONS DEMOCRATIC
AND ACCOUNTABLE AND THEREFORE ENTITLED TO POSITIVE RIGHTS INCLUDING THE
RIGHT TO RECOGNITION AND THE RIGHT TO STRIKE BALANCED BY THE ACCEPTANCE OF
THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO THEIR MEMBERS, THEIR INDUSTRIES AND TO THE WIDER
COMMUNITY.

TO REDUCE INDUSTRIAL CONFLICT WE SUPPORT A SYSTEM OF REFERRING DISPUTES TO
INDEPENDENT ARBITRATION PRIOR TO ANY INDUSTRIAL ACTION. WE WILL ALSO
ENCOURAGE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FREELY NEGOTIATED STRIKE-FREE AGREEMENTS
ESPECIALLY IN THE PROVISION OF ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES.

WE WILL TAKE ACTION THROUGH EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND CONTRACT COMPLIANCE
POLICIES TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ETHNIC MINORITIES AND WOMEN.

WE WILL ACTIVELY PROMOTE MEASURES THAT GIVE EMPLOYEES WITH FAMILY
RESPONSIBILITIES MINIMUM RIGHTS TO PARENTAL AND FAMILY LEAVE.

AGRICULTURE

THE ALLIANCE WILL PROMOTE A HEALTHY FARMING INDUSTRY. WE MUST ARREST THE
PRECIPITOUS DECLINE IN FARM INCOMES OF RECENT YEARS. OUR POLICIES FOR
ALIGNING SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE ARE DESIGNED TO SECURE
FAIR RETURNS FOR FARMERS' EFFORTS. ADEQUATE PRICE AND INCOME SUPPORT IS
REQUIRED TO ENABLE NECESSARY FARMING ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MADE.

WE WILL JOIN THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM OF THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM TO
LOWER INTEREST RATES, PROMOTE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND PREVENT UNFAIR
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST BRITISH FARMERS THROUGH OVER-VALUATION OF THE GREEN
POUND.

THE ALLIANCE WILL WORK TO REFORM THE CAP; THE POLICY HAS ACHIEVED SECURE
FOOD SUPPLIES BUT HAS GONE ON UNCHECKED TO PRODUCE WASTEFUL AND HUGELY
EXPENSIVE SURPLUSES. MANY FARMERS WHO BORROWED HEAVILY ON INFLATED LAND
PRICES TO MEET PRODUCTION DEMANDS ARE NOW THREATENED WITH BANKRUPTCY. THE
ALLIANCE WILL SECURE THE INCOME OF BRITISH FAMILY FARMS BY NEGOTIATING
ADEQUATE GUARANTEED PRICES FOR DETERMINED QUANTITIES OF PRODUCTION, WITH
ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES DISPOSED AT MUCH LOWER FLOOR INTERVENTION PRICES: A
TWO-TIER PRICING SYSTEM. AN ELIGIBLE TONNAGE FOR EACH MEMBER-STATE WILL BE
AGREED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DIFFERING FARM STRUCTURES IN THE COMMUNITY.

WE WILL SEEK A FAIRER SHARE OF MILK QUOTA FOR BRITISH PRODUCERS AND THE
RETENTION OF THE RIGHT TO QUOTA TRANSFER AND LEASING. TRANSFER OF QUOTAS
THROUGH AN AGENCY WOULD CREATE A POOL OF QUOTA TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE
MILK MARKETING BOARD AND WOULD HELP SMALL FAMILY FARMS.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THE LESS FAVOURED AREAS, AND ENSURING THAT
THE UPLAND BEEF AND SHEEP INDUSTRIES ARE SAFEGUARDED THROUGH DIFFERENTIAL
PREMIA AND RETENTION OF THE SHEEPMEAT REGIME.

WE SHALL INCREASE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR EFFECTIVE MARKETING SCHEMES FOR
FARM PRODUCE AT HOME AND ABROAD. FARM-BASED PROCESSING AND MARKETING
CO-OPERATIVES WILL BE ASSISTED TO RETAIN MORE OF THE SELLING PRICE OF
FOODSTUFFS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE CONSERVATION, THE REDUCED USE OF CHEMICAL INPUTS, ORGANIC
FARMING AND LESS INTENSIVE METHODS OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION. THE GOVERNMENT'S
CUTS IN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND ADVICE WILL BE REVERSED.
SPECIAL EFFORTS WILL BE DEVOTED TO LOWERING INPUT COSTS. THE ALLIANCE WILL
SPONSOR PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY TO PROMOTE BOTH RESEARCH
INTO NEW USES FOR FARM PRODUCE WHICH WILL HELP TO SUSTAIN INCOMES AND INTO
THE IMPROVEMENT OF ANIMAL WELFARE.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE FARMERS TO DIVERSIFY TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE NEEDS OF TENANT
FARMERS AND OTHER SMALL FAMILY FARMS. WE WILL MAKE ANNUAL PAYMENTS FOR THE
UPKEEP OF IMPORTANT AMENITIES SUCH AS WALLS, HEDGES, FOOTPATHS AND MEADOWS.
WE WILL PROVIDE FURTHER SUPPORT FOR THE CUSTODIANSHIP OF AREAS OF
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPORTANCE, AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MIXED FORESTRY ON THE
FARM WITH ESTABLISHMENT GRANTS AND ANNUAL PAYMENTS FOR GROWERS. WE WILL
PROPOSE CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR LAND USE TO ASSIST DIVERSIFICATION AND TO
PROTECT THE COUNTRYSIDE.

THE ALLIANCE REJECTS PROPOSALS TO RATE FARM LAND OR BUILDINGS. WE ALSO
REJECT THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS FOR A POLL TAX WHICH WILL APPLY TO FARMERS
AND FARM WORKERS AND, UNLIKE ALLIANCE PROPOSALS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT INCOME
TAX, IS NOT BASED ON THE ABILITY TO PAY.

THE ALLIANCE WISHES TO SUPPORT NEW ENTRANTS TO THE FARMING INDUSTRY, AND
THEREFORE PROPOSES THE RETENTION OF COUNTY COUNCIL SMALLHOLDINGS AND THE
PROMOTION OF TAX INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE LANDLORDS TO LET MORE LAND.

WE WOULD PROMOTE LOCAL RURAL EMPLOYMENT, INCLUDING FARM-BASED TOURISM,
THROUGH PROPERLY FUNDED RURAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND BY MEANS OF A CREDIT
SCHEME WHICH WOULD PROVIDE WORKING CAPITAL AT LOW RATES OF INTEREST TO
AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL INDUSTRIES.

WE WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CREDIT UNION (OR FARM BANK)
DESIGNED TO HELP FARMERS SECURE FINANCE AT FAIR AND REASONABLE RATES.

FISHING

THE ALLIANCE IN GOVERNMENT WILL ACT TO STRENGTHEN THE CONTRIBUTION THE
FISHING INDUSTRY CAN MAKE TO THE LIVELIHOOD OF RURAL COMMUNITIES.

AFTER MANY YEARS OF TURMOIL FROM THE LOSS OF TRADITIONAL DISTANT WATER
FISHING GROUNDS AND THE PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS FOR A FAIR COMMON FISHING
POLICY, WHAT BRITISH FISHERMEN NOW NEED ABOVE ALL IS STABILITY TO PLAN AND
INVEST FOR THE FUTURE. WE WILL:

   * IMPROVE THE CONSERVATION OF FISH STOCKS BY THE USE OF LICENSING AND
     TECHNICAL MEANS THAT WILL SAFEGUARD STOCKS AND DECENTRALISE THE
     ADMINISTRATION OF QUANTITATIVE CONTROLS SO AS TO GIVE FISHERMEN GREATER
     RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF NECESSARY CONSERVATION MEASURES
     WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO RECOGNISE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES.
   * STRENGTHEN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY INSPECTORATE SO AS TO ACHIEVE FAIR
     ENFORCEMENT BY ALL MEMBER-STATES.
   * WE WILL SUPPORT BETTER VOCATIONAL TRAINING, FISH PROCESSING AND
     MARKETING AND EXPORT PROMOTION UNDER THE CO-ORDINATION OF THE SEAFISH
     INDUSTRY AUTHORITY.
   * WE WOULD NOT IMPOSE LIGHT DUES ON FISHING VESSELS.

THE ALLIANCE BELIEVES THAT THESE POLICIES WILL HELP TO SECURE JOBS, GREATER
PROSPERITY, GREATER FAIRNESS, AND A SENSE OF PRIDE IN THE INDUSTRIES UPON
WHICH OUR FUTURE DEPENDS.

HEALTH AND COMMUNITY CARE

THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE IS IN A STATE OF FUNDAMENTAL CRISIS AND MALAISE.
IT IS SUFFERING SHORTAGES AND DECLINING STANDARDS. OUR PEOPLE ARE SEEING
THEIR SERVICES CUT, THEIR WAITING LISTS LENGTHENED, AND MORE AND MORE NEEDS
GOING UNMET. UNLESS A GOVERNMENT IS ELECTED AGAIN WHICH IS COMMITTED TO THE
IDEAS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE, ONE OF THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS
OF 20TH CENTURY CIVILISED SOCIETY COULD BE IN IRREVERSIBLE DECLINE.

WE WILL BACK THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE BY INCREASING ITS BUDGET SO THAT BY
YEAR FIVE IT WILL BE £1 BILLION PER ANNUM HIGHER THAN THAT PLANNED BY THE
CONSERVATIVES. OUR HEALTH SERVICE WAS ONCE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD: NOW THE
STRAINS UNDER WHICH IT IS WORKING ARE WELL KNOWN, AND WE ARE LOSING SOME OF
THE BEST HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN NO LONGER DO THE JOB THEY WERE TRAINED
TO DO BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE RESOURCES. WE AIM TO RESTORE A SENSE OF PRIDE IN
THE HEALTH SERVICE AND TO GIVE IT A NEW SENSE OF DIRECTION. OUR PRIORITIES
FOR CHANGE ARE:

   * TO PROVIDE PROMPT MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT, REGARDLESS
     OF WHO THEY ARE OR WHERE THEY LIVE. THERE ARE HUGE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN
     AND WITHIN REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY IN AVAILABILITY OF HOSPITAL TREATMENT
     AND FAMILY DOCTOR SERVICES. WE WOULD SET ASIDE SPECIAL FUNDS - BUILDING
     ON THE RECENTLY INTRODUCED FUNDS TO CUT WAITING LISTS - TO BACK GOOD
     PRACTICE. THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED PRESCRIPTION
     CHARGES BY 240% OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WHICH IS MUCH HIGHER THAN
     INFLATION. WE WILL NOT INCREASE PRESCRIPTION CHARGES BEYOND THE
     INFLATION RATE;
   * TO PROMOTE GOOD HEALTH, NOT MERELY TO TREAT ILLNESS. THIS MEANS
     TARGETING RESOURCES IN HEALTH EDUCATION, PROMOTING HEALTHY EATING,
     TIGHTENING UP FOOD LABELLING AND FACING UP TO THE PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY
     SMOKING AND ALCOHOL ABUSE. WE WILL BAN ADVERTISING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS.
     OUR POLICIES TO DEAL WITH UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY AND POOR HOUSING ARE
     CRUCIAL IN REDUCING ILL-HEALTH THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE TEAM WORKING
     WITH FAMILY DOCTORS MUST BE BUILT UP AND THEIR PREVENTIVE WORK
     EXPANDED. THERE SHOULD BE MORE SCREENING, INCLUDING WELL-WOMEN CLINICS,
     WITH EFFICIENT FOLLOW-UP FOR KNOWN RISK GROUPS;
   * TO CREATE A NEW INNOVATION FUND, TO TACKLE INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH CARE,
     IMPROVE THE "CINDERELLA SERVICES", AND TO FUND NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND NEW
     PRIORITIES IN HEALTH CARE; THIS WILL HAVE AN INITIAL LIFE OF FIVE
     YEARS, WITH A BUDGET WHICH WILL TOTAL £250 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE
     YEARS. THIS WILL BE IN ADDITION TO MONEY SPENT ON CREATING NEW JOBS
     CARING IN THE COMMUNITY;
   * TO MAKE "CARE IN THE COMMUNITY" A REALITY. WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO SEE
     PATIENTS TURNED OUT OF THE OLD INSTITUTIONAL HOSPITALS WITHOUT ADEQUATE
     FACILITIES TO CARE FOR THEM IN THE COMMUNITY. WE WANT TO SUPPORT
     "CARERS" WHO LOOK AFTER ELDERLY AND HANDICAPPED PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN
     FAMILIES AND THEIR OWN HOMES. WE INTEND TO INTRODUCE A CARERS' BENEFIT,
     AND WE WANT CARERS TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A BREAK FROM THEIR
     RESPONSIBILITIES.

     HOWEVER, WE RECOGNISE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE GOOD INSTITUTIONAL CARE
     REMAINS THE BEST SOLUTION;
   * TO STRENGTHEN PATIENTS' RIGHTS, THROUGH STATUTORY ACCESS FOR THE
     INDIVIDUAL TO HIS OR HER OWN MEDICAL FILES, THROUGH MORE OPPORTUNITIES
     FOR PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS AND THROUGH STRONGER COMMUNITY
     HEALTH COUNCILS;
   * TO GIVE REAL INDEPENDENCE TO THE HEALTH EDUCATION AUTHORITY;
   * TO RESTRUCTURE THE NURSING PROFESSION ALONG THE LINES PROPOSED IN
     PROJECT 2000.

IN THE LONGER TERM WE WANT TO SEE HEALTH AUTHORITIES BROUGHT UNDER
DEMOCRATIC CONTROL AT LOCAL LEVEL, BUT THE NHS HAS SUFFERED SO MANY BOUTS OF
REORGANISATION UNDER SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS THAT FOR THE MOMENT THE PRIORITY
MUST BE TO LET THOSE RUNNING THE SERVICE GET ON WITH THE JOB.

WE WOULD REMOVE THE CENTRALISING PRESSURE TO MAKE ALL AUTHORITIES DO THINGS
IN THE SAME WAY, AND WE WOULD LEAVE AUTHORITIES WITH MORE FREEDOM TO DECIDE,
FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER PRIVATISATION OF SERVICES WAS LIKELY TO IMPROVE PATIENT
CARE OR NOT; WE WOULD GIVE THESE AUTHORITIES MORE DIRECT CONTROL OVER THEIR
BUDGETS.

WE UPHOLD THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO USE THEIR OWN RESOURCES TO OBTAIN
PRIVATE MEDICAL CARE, BUT WE WILL NOT ALLOW PRIVATE MEDICINE TO EXPLOIT THE
NHS BY USING FACILITIES AT SUBSIDISED COST AND WE WILL WORK TO END THE
DELAYS WHICH GIVE RISE TO "QUEUE-JUMPING" THROUGH PRIVATE MEDICINE.

RIGHT TO TREATMENT

NO CLIENT OF THE NHS SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS FOR HOSPITAL
TREATMENT. NO-ONE SHOULD BE KEPT WAITING FOR YEARS IN PAIN, WITH UNNECESSARY
CRIPPLING DISABILITIES FOR LACK OF A HOSPITAL BED. PATIENTS SHOULD HAVE THE
RIGHT TO TREATMENT IN OTHER AUTHORITIES WHERE THERE IS SPARE CAPACITY.

THE ALLIANCE WILL WORK TO ENSURE THAT EVERY PATIENT RECEIVES HOSPITAL
TREATMENT FOR ROUTINE OPERATIONS WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF REFERRAL BY A GP. THE
BACKLOG OF PEOPLE WAITING IS NOW OF CRISIS PROPORTIONS. WE ESTIMATE IT WILL
TAKE TWO YEARS TO REDUCE THE MAXIMUM WAITING TIME TO ONE YEAR. WE AIM TO
REDUCE THIS TO WITHIN SIX MONTHS DURING OUR FIRST TERM OF OFFICE.

TO END LONG WAITING LISTS DISTRICT HEALTH AUTHORITIES AND HEALTH BOARDS WILL
BE EMPOWERED TO:-

   * BUY AND SELL HOSPITAL TREATMENT FROM EACH OTHER TO OBTAIN THE BEST AND
     QUICKEST SERVICE;
   * BUY SERVICES FROM OTHER DISTRICTS WITH SURPLUSES. SELLING SERVICES
     BETWEEN DHAS WOULD BE A NEW INCENTIVE FOR GOOD MANAGEMENT PRACTICE
     RATHER THAN PENALISE SUCCESS;
   * PAY TRAVELLING COSTS FOR PATIENTS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TRANSPORT OUT OF
     THEIR DISTRICTS;
   * APPOINT MORE HOSPITAL DOCTORS AND NEGOTIATE WITH CONSULTANTS SO THAT
     THEY GIVE PRIORITY TO THEIR NHS WAITING LISTS RATHER THAN ON PRIVATE
     PRACTICE;
   * ENSURE AN INCREASED NUMBER OF PLACES IN LOCAL HOSPITALS FOR
     CONVALESCENCE AND COMMUNITY CARE TO RELEASE BEDS FOR ACUTE TREATMENT.

GPS WILL NEED TO HAVE FULL COMPUTERISED INFORMATION ON WAITING LISTS WHEN
THEY MAKE THEIR FIRST REFERRALS. THERE ARE ALREADY SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS WITHIN
THE NHS FOR COMPUTERISATION AND THE ALLIANCE WILL ENSURE ALL GPS CAN BE
LINKED TO HOSPITALS NATION-WIDE.

IN CONSULTATION WITH THE MEDICAL PROFESSION, WE WILL DRAW UP AND REGULARLY
REVIEW A LIST OF ROUTINE OPERATIONS SUCH AS HIP REPLACEMENT FOR WHICH ALL
PATIENTS SHOULD EXPECT TREATMENT WITHIN OUR SIX MONTH TARGET.

IN CONSULTATION WITH DISTRICT HEALTH AUTHORITIES, WE WILL AGREE ALLOCATIONS
OF EXTRA RESOURCES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE NUMBERS OF PATIENTS FROM OUTSIDE
THEIR AREA THAT DISTRICTS ARE ALREADY TREATING.

THE VITAL ROLE OF THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR

IN HEALTH AND IN MANY OTHER FIELDS OF SERVICE THE WORK OF VOLUNTEERS AND
VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS IS VITAL: THE ALLIANCE SEES NO BENEFIT IN STATE
MONOPOLY, AND WELCOMES THE DEDICATION, INNOVATION AND DIVERSITY WHICH THE
VOLUNTARY SECTOR CAN BRING. WE WANT A MORE STABLE FRAMEWORK FOR THE
VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS MAKING THEM LESS DEPENDENT ON SHORT-TERM FUNDING
WHICH CAN BE MISUSED BY LOCAL COUNCILS AND GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AS A MEANS
OF EXERTING POLITICAL CONTROL IN THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR. WE WILL:-

   * EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTARY EFFORT, GIVING YOUNG
     PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CHANCE TO VOLUNTEER FULL-TIME FOR A YEAR
     WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY ENTITLEMENTS AND BY LINKING
     EXISTING VOLUNTARY GROUPS WITH NEW INITIATIVES;
   * ENSURE THAT EXPERIENCE GAINED BY VOLUNTEERS IS GIVEN PROPER
     ACCREDITATION TO ENABLE THOSE WITHOUT TRADITIONAL QUALIFICATIONS TO
     GAIN ACCESS TO FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION;
   * ENSURE ADEQUATE PUBLIC CORE FUNDING TO ENABLE VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS
     TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF TAX CONCESSIONS ON PAYROLL GIVING AND
     INDIVIDUAL DONORS;
   * SUPPORT SERVICES WHICH ADVISE VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS ON HOW TO DEVELOP
     THEIR MANAGEMENT SKILLS AND STRUCTURES TO ENSURE STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND
     BETTER SERVICE DELIVERY;
   * SUPPORT AND HELP TO WIDEN THE NETWORK OF CITIZENS ADVICE BUREAUX, LAW
     CENTRES AND OTHER LEGAL ADVICE SERVICES.

ENDING POVERTY

WE CAN AND WILL RELIEVE MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM THE BURDEN OF POVERTY.

POVERTY IN BRITAIN IS GETTING WORSE. THE CONSERVATIVES' TAXATION AND BENEFIT
POLICIES HAVE REDISTRIBUTED INCOME FROM THE POOR TO THE RICH, FROM PEOPLE
WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN TO SINGLE PEOPLE AND CHILDLESS COUPLES, AND FROM ONE
GROUP OF THE POOR TO ANOTHER GROUP OF THE POOR. THIS IS UNJUST AND
UNACCEPTABLE. THE ALLIANCE WILL TACKLE POVERTY BY TARGETING MUCH HIGHER
BENEFITS TO THOSE WITH THE LOWEST INCOMES IN RELATION TO THEIR NEEDS. WE
WILL HELP FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. WE WILL IMPROVE BENEFITS FOR THE DISABLED
AND THOSE CARING FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED RELATIVES AT HOME.

OUR PROPOSALS FALL INTO TWO PARTS:

   * FIRST, WE WILL, OVER THE FIRST TWO YEARS, IMPROVE THE INCOMES OF
     PENSIONERS, FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, THE UNEMPLOYED, DISABLED AND
     CARERS. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE PAID FOR IN PART FROM INCREASING
     PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BY A NET £1.75 BILLION BY THE SECOND YEAR. THE
     REMAINDER WILL BE PAID FOR FROM INCREASED TAX REVENUES AND FROM CHANGES
     WHICH WILL MAKE THE TAX SYSTEM FAIRER.
   * THE SECOND PHASE OF OUR PROPOSALS WILL BE A RESTRUCTURING OF THE TAX
     AND BENEFITS SYSTEMS TO CREATE ONE INTEGRATED SYSTEM WHICH WILL BE
     SIMPLER AND FAIRER.

THE IMMEDIATE PACKAGE

PENSIONERS

WE INTEND TO CONCENTRATE THE BULK OF EXTRA SPENDING ON HELPING POORER
PENSIONERS WITH INCOMES ON AND JUST ABOVE THE STATE RETIREMENT PENSION. WE
WILL INCREASE THE BASIC STATE RETIREMENT PENSION BY £2.30 A WEEK FOR A
SINGLE PERSON AND £3.65 FOR A MARRIED COUPLE. THIS WILL INCLUDE THE FORECAST
UPDATE OF THE PENSION IN 1988. FOR POORER PENSIONERS WE WILL INTRODUCE AN
ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF £3.70 A WEEK FOR SINGLE PEOPLE AND £5.75 FOR COUPLES.
THIS WILL INCREASE THE INCOMES OF POORER PENSIONERS IN TOTAL BY £6 PER WEEK
(SINGLE PERSON) AND £9.40 PER WEEK (COUPLE).

WE WILL INTRODUCE A DEATH GRANT OF £400, RECOVERABLE FROM THE ESTATE OF THE
DECEASED, SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO HELP PENSIONERS WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF
SAVINGS FEEL CONFIDENT THAT MOST OF THEIR, OR THEIR SPOUSE'S, FUNERAL COSTS
WILL BE COVERED BY THE GRANT;

WE WILL REQUIRE STANDING CHARGES FOR GAS, ELECTRICITY AND TELEPHONES TO BE
ABOLISHED FOR EVERYONE

THE £10 CHRISTMAS BONUS HAS BECAME HOPELESSLY INADEQUATE TO MEET THE EXTRA
SPENDING PENSIONERS AND WIDOWS FACE AT CHRISTMAS.

WE WILL INCREASE THE BONUS BY PAYING A DOUBLE PENSION IN THE FIRST WEEK OF
DECEMBER. A SINGLE PERSON WILL RECEIVE £39.50 AND A MARRIED COUPLE £63.25.
THE NET COST WILL BE £268 MILLION.

CHILD BENEFIT

WE WILL INCREASE CHILD BENEFIT BY £1 PER CHILD A WEEK IN THE FIRST YEAR AND
BY A FURTHER £1 PER CHILD A WEEK IN THE SECOND YEAR.

MATERNITY GRANT

WE WILL INTRODUCE A MATERNITY GRANT OF £150 FOR THE FIRST CHILD BORN IN
EVERY FAMILY AND OF £75 FOR THE BIRTHS OF EACH SUBSEQUENT CHILD;

FAMILIES IN WORK

WE WILL ADD £5 PER WEEK TO THE FAMILY CREDIT DUE TO BE INTRODUCED IN APRIL
1968 AS A REPLACEMENT TO FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT. THESE FAMILIES WILL ALSO
GAIN FROM THE EXTRA CHILD BENEFIT. UNLIKE THE CONSERVATIVES WE WILL RETAIN
AT THIS STAGE FREE SCHOOL MEALS AND MILK FOR FAMILY CREDIT RECIPIENTS
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FAMILIES ARE IN WORK OR NOT; THIS WILL ENSURE
EQUAL TREATMENT WITH FAMILIES DEPENDENT ON BENEFITS.

FAMILIES OUT OF WORK

WE WILL INCREASE THE FAMILY PREMIUM UNDER THE INCOME SUPPORT SCHEME BY £5
PER WEEK AND, IN THIS FIRST PHASE, WE WILL INCREASE THE NET AMOUNT PER CHILD
RECEIVED BY INCOME SUPPORT FAMILIES BY £2 PER CHILD PER WEEK;

SINGLE PARENTS

WE WILL INCREASE THE SINGLE PARENT PREMIUM FOR INCOME SUPPORT RECIPIENTS BY
£1.10 A WEEK, SINGLE PARENTS WILL ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASED CHILD
BENEFIT AND, IF THEIR EARNINGS ARE LOW, FROM THE EXTRA £5 ON FAMILY CREDIT.
IF THEY ARE NOT IN PAID EMPLOYMENT THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM HIGHER FAMILY
PREMIUM AND THE CHILD ADDITIONS.

YOUNG PEOPLE

THE CONSERVATIVES' BENEFIT CHANGES INCLUDE SETTING A NEW LOW PERSONAL
ALLOWANCE FOR UNEMPLOYED 18-24 YEAR OLDS WITH A HIGHER PERSONAL ALLOWANCE
FOR SINGLE PEOPLE 25 AND OVER. WE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS DISCRIMINATION BASED
ON AGE AND WE WILL ABOLISH THE 18-24 INCOME SUPPORT RATE TO ENSURE THAT ALL
SINGLE PEOPLE RECEIVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF BENEFIT;

LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED

WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW PREMIUM UNDER THE INCOME SUPPORT SCHEME FOR THE
LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED WITHOUT DEPENDENT CHILDREN OF £3.50 A WEEK FOR A SINGLE
PERSON AND £5 FOR A COUPLE;

SOCIAL FUND

WE WILL NOT PLACE CASH LIMITS ON THE SOCIAL FUND AND WE WILL REPLACE LOANS
WITH GRANTS. WE WILL ESTABLISH CLEAR CRITERIA OF ELIGIBILITY FOR SPECIAL
PAYMENTS AND A RIGHT OF INDEPENDENT APPEAL AND WILL ENSURE THAT THE VERY
POOR RECEIVE EXTRA MONEY TO COVER HEATING COSTS;

HOUSING BENEFIT

WE WILL NOT IMPOSE A 20% RATES CHARGE ON THOSE WITH VERY LOW INCOMES AS THE
CONSERVATIVES PLAN TO DO FROM APRIL 1988. WE WILL NOT IMPLEMENT THE
CONSERVATIVES' PROPOSED CUTS IN THE FUNDING OF HOUSING BENEFIT.

THE TOTAL GROSS COST OF THIS IMMEDIATE PACKAGE OVER TWO YEARS IS £3.6
BILLION AND THE NET COST IS £1.75 BILLION, WHICH WILL BE MET FROM OUR
PLANNED EXPANSION OF THE ECONOMY. PART OF THE COST OF THE PACKAGE WILL BE
MET BY CHANGES TO THE TAX SYSTEM, AND BY STARTING TO PHASE IN INDEPENDENT
TAXATION FOR MARRIED WOMEN.

WE WILL CHANGE THE CURRENT PERSONAL TAX ALLOWANCES INTO A STANDARD ALLOWANCE
WORTH THE SAME VALUE FOR ALL TAXPAYERS AND WILL NOT UPRATE THE MARRIED MAN'S
TAX ALLOWANCE. PENSIONERS', SINGLE PERSON'S AND WIFE'S EARNED INCOME
ALLOWANCES WILL CONTINUE TO BE UPRATED WITH INFLATION. WE WILL CONFINE
MORTGAGE TAX RELIEF TO THE BASIC RATE OF TAX, SO THAT ALL TAXPAYERS BENEFIT
EQUALLY FROM IT AT THE SAME RATE.

PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

THE BIGGEST HANDICAP FACED BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IS THE BARRIERS PUT
UP BY THE REST OF US TO THEIR PARTICIPATION IN SOCIETY. THE ALLIANCE
THEREFORE SUPPORTS MEASURES WHICH REDUCE THE PHYSICAL AND ATTITUDINAL
OBSTACLES FACED BY THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AND WHICH ENABLE ALL TO ENJOY AS
MANY AS POSSIBLE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH ARE OFTEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY
THE ABLE-BODIED.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WISH TO LIVE AN
INDEPENDENT LIFE IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN THEIR OWN HOME. IN SUPPORT OF THIS
WE WILL:-

   * SPEED UP THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DISABLED PERSONS ACT 1986;
   * INCREASE THE INCOME OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON
     BENEFITS BY £3.50 PER WEEK AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT
     THROUGH OUR TAX AND BENEFIT PROPOSALS;
   * ENSURE THAT 'CARE IN THE COMMUNITY', POLICIES ARE PROPERLY CO-ORDINATED
     AND FUNDED, UNLIKE THE CURRENT SITUATION WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY
     THE AUDIT COMMISSION AS RESULTING IN "POOR VALUE FOR MONEY AND
     UNNECESSARY SUFFERING";
   * TACKLE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DISABLED PEOPLE THROUGH OUR PROPOSED NEW
     BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION;
   * SUPPORT THE VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS OF AND FOR DISABLED PEOPLE AND
     ENSURE THAT THEY ARE PROPERLY CONSULTED ON MATTERS WHICH AFFECT THEM;
   * ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS OF DISABLED PEOPLE ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN
     HOUSING, PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT OPERATORS. WE WOULD
     EXPAND SUPPORT FOR THE SPECIALISED TRANSPORT WHICH CAN OFTEN BE THE KEY
     TO INDEPENDENT LIVING FOR PEOPLE WITH LIMITED MOBILITY;
   * IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF EDUCATION FOR THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS, IN
     COLLEGES AS WELL AS FL SCHOOLS, BACKED BY A NATIONAL ADVISORY
     COMMITTEE.

PEOPLE CARING FOR DEPENDENT RELATIVES

WE WILL LEGISLATE THROUGH THE CARERS' CHARTER FOR CARERS' NEEDS. WE WILL
REPLACE INVALID CARE ALLOWANCE BY A MORE GENEROUS CARERS' BENEFIT.

WE WILL SEEK TO IMPROVE THE POSITION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN OUR
SOCIETY.

THE SECOND STAGE

THE NEXT STAGE WILL BE TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE TAX AND
BENEFIT SYSTEMS. WE WILL REPLACE INCOME SUPPORT AND FAMILY CREDIT BY A NEW
BASIC BENEFIT FOR THOSE IN OR OUT OF WORK. BASIC BENEFIT ENTITLEMENT WILL BE
GRADUALLY REDUCED AS INCOME RISES. CHILD BENEFIT WILL BE PAYABLE TO ALL
ALIKE, WHETHER THEY ARE IN OR OUT OF WORK.

WE WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO MERGE THE TAX AND BENEFITS SYSTEMS, AND
EMPLOYEES' NICS WITH INCOME TAX AT A HIGH THRESHOLD. THESE STRUCTURAL
CHANGES WILL NOT COME INTO EFFECT UNTIL THE SECOND PARLIAMENT.

IN THE MEANTIME WE WILL CONTINUE TO FREEZE THE MARRIED MAN'S TAX ALLOWANCE,
AND THIS EXTRA REVENUE WILL ENABLE US FURTHER TO IMPROVE BENEFITS FOR
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND CARERS.

OUR LONGER-TERM OBJECTIVES

WE WILL REFORM CAPITAL TAXATION TO ENCOURAGE WIDER DISTRIBUTION OF GIFTS AND
LEGACIES;

WIDER TAX RELIEF FOR SAVINGS, INCLUDING SAVINGS DIRECTLY INVESTED IN SMALL
BUSINESSES, ENDING THE ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN INCOME FROM EARNING
AND INCOME FROM INVESTMENT;

WE WOULD MOVE TOWARDS AN EQUAL AND FLEXIBLE RETIREMENT AGE FOR MEN AND WOMEN
GIVING EVERYONE THE RIGHT TO RETIRE AT ANY AGE FROM 60 TO 70, WITH A REDUCED
PENSION FOR THOSE RETIRING BELOW 65 BUT PROTECTION FOR WOMEN CURRENTLY
APPROACHING RETIREMENT AT 60;

WE WILL AIM TO RESTORE THE LINK BETWEEN PENSIONS AND AVERAGE EARNINGS,
BROKEN BY THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, WHICH WILL BECOME MORE FEASIBLE IF OUR
PLANS TO ACHIEVE GROWTH WHILE RESTRAINING INFLATION ARE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO
SUCCEED.

EDUCATION: THE ESSENTIAL INVESTMENT

WE WILL INCREASE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING BY AN ADDITIONAL £2
BILLION PER ANNUM BEYOND THAT PLANNED BY THE CONSERVATIVES BY THE FIFTH
YEAR.

BRITAIN LAGS FAR BEHIND OUR MAIN INDUSTRIAL COMPETITORS IN THE PROPORTION OF
OUR PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE HIGHER EDUCATION, FURTHER EDUCATION AND SKILL
TRAINING. BASIC RESEARCH IS SERIOUSLY UNDERFUNDED. AS A RESULT, INDUSTRY
LACKS THE QUALIFIED AND SKILLED PEOPLE IT NEEDS, AND INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT
GIVEN THE CHANCE TO DEVELOP THEIR POTENTIAL.

WE AIM:

   * TO WIDEN ACCESS TO EDUCATION;
   * TO RAISE STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS;
   * TO INCREASE RESEARCH;
   * TO PROVIDE MORE EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND SKILLS.

OUR SCHOOLS ARE IN TURMOIL. THE DECISION OF THE TWO LARGEST TEACHERS UNIONS
TO CONDUCT A SERIES OF STRIKES IN PROTEST AT THE REMOVAL OF THEIR BARGAINING
RIGHTS BY THE TEACHERS PAY AND CONDITIONS ACT, MEANS ANOTHER TERM OF
DISRUPTED EDUCATION FOR THE CHILDREN OF ENGLAND AND WALES, WITH ESPECIALLY
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE TAKING PUBLIC EXAMINATIONS THIS SUMMER. MANY
OF THESE PUPILS HAVE SUFFERED REPEATED DISRUPTION OF THEIR SCHOOLING OVER
THE PAST THREE YEARS; THEY ARE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIONS.

TO CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT'S PRESENT POLICY, WHICH WOULD DENY
TO THE TEACHERS NEGOTIATING RIGHTS FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS, CANNOT CREATE
THE MUTUAL TRUST BETWEEN THE TEACHERS, THE LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES AND
THE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVED MORALE IN THE
PROFESSION. WITHOUT AN IMPROVEMENT IN MORALE, PLEDGES OF HIGHER STANDARDS
ARE IN VAIN; HIGHER STANDARDS IN THE SCHOOLS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY A
COMMITTED SELF-RESPECTING TEACHING PROFESSION.

THE TEACHERS UNIONS HAVE BEEN DIVIDED AMONG THEMSELVES ON PAY AND
CONDITIONS. THAT IS WHY THE ALLIANCE URGED EARLIER THIS YEAR IN THE HOUSE OF
LORDS THAT AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW BODY SHOULD PUT FORWARD RECOMMENDATIONS AS
A BASIS FOR NEGOTIATION. THAT WAS DONE BY THE MAIN COMMITTEE IN SCOTLAND;
AFTER AN AGREED SETTLEMENT, DISRUPTION CEASED IN SCOTTISH SCHOOLS.

THE ALLIANCE BELIEVES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TEACHERS
PAY AND CONDITIONS WOULD BE IMPOSED FOR THE CURRENT SETTLEMENT ONLY; AND
THAT AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW BODY WOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO MAKE PROPOSALS ON
TEACHERS' PAY AND CONDITIONS AS A BASIS OF NEGOTIATION. WE UNDERSTAND AND
SYMPATHISE WITH THE TEACHERS' ANGER AT THE REMOVAL OF THEIR NEGOTIATING
RIGHTS. WE WOULD RESTORE THEM. BUT THE ACTION BY THE TEACHERS UNIONS SHOULD
CEASE. IT DOES NOTHING TO ACHIEVE THEIR AIMS. IT IS DAMAGING PUPILS'
EDUCATION, IS ALIENATING PUBLIC OPINION AND UNDERMINING THE STANDING OF
TEACHERS IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS IN NO-ONE'S INTEREST THAT IT CONTINUES.

INVESTING IN QUALITY

A NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR RAISING EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS - THE ALLIANCE TEN
POINT PLAN.

   * ENCOURAGING PROGRESS
     WE WILL REQUIRE ALL SCHOOLS, BOTH MAINTAINED AND INDEPENDENT, TO
     PUBLISH INDICATORS SHOWING PROGRESS IN ACADEMIC RESULTS RELATED TO
     INTAKE AND SOCIAL FACTORS SUCH AS COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT, TRUANCY, AND
     DELINQUENCY.
   * SETTING GOALS
     WE WILL ASK EACH SCHOOL TO SET TARGETS FOR IMPROVEMENT - IN THE CASE OF
     MAINTAINED SCHOOLS, IN CONSULTATION WITH THEIR LOCAL EDUCATION
     AUTHORITY.
   * ASSISTING IMPROVEMENT
     WE WILL INSTITUTE 'SPECIAL INSPECTIONS' OF ALL SCHOOLS WHICH REGULARLY
     FALL BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL IN TERMS OF PROGRESS ACHIEVED.
   * REWARDING EXCELLENCE
     WE WILL INSTITUTE AN ANNUAL 'QUEEN'S AWARD' FOR SCHOOLS, TO BE JUDGED
     BY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL OF EXPERTS, FOR OUTSTANDING PROGRESS, TEACHING
     AND CURRICULUM INNOVATION AND SUCCESS.
   * PROMOTING PROFESSIONALISM
     WE WILL ESTABLISH 'TEACHER FELLOWSHIPS' AS ONE YEAR AWARDS TO
     OUTSTANDING TEACHERS.
   * SPREADING TECHNOLOGY
     WE WILL DEVELOP INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CENTRES AS RESOURCES OF
     TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL COLLEGES,
     POLYTECHNICS AND UNIVERSITIES AND COMPUTING.
   * ENRICHING EXPERIENCE
     WE WILL INITIATE A PILOT PROJECT OF SUMMER SCHOOLS, TARGETED ON INNER
     CITY CHILDREN, TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE ACROSS THE CURRICULUM; WE WILL
     APPROACH INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE AND MAKE THEIR FACILITIES
     AVAILABLE FOR THESE SUMMER SCHOOLS.
   * BOOSTING NUMERACY
     WE WILL INAUGURATE A NATIONAL NUMERACY CAMPAIGN, BACKED BY ADVERTISING
     AND TELEVISION.
   * INVOLVING PARENTS
     WE WILL LAUNCH PILOT PROJECTS FOR PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN SCHOOLS.
   * EMPOWERING PARENTS
     WE WILL ESTABLISH A 'CODE OF GOOD PRACTICE' FOR LOCAL EDUCATION
     AUTHORITIES INCLUDING:
        O PARENTS HAVING A VOICE ON EDUCATION COMMITTEES;
        O LEAS PUBLISHING THEIR POLICIES ON HOME/SCHOOL LINKS;
        O LEAS APPOINTING AN ADVISORY OFFICER WITH SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY
          FOR DEVELOPING A CLOSER PARTNERSHIP WITH PARENTS;
        O THE TRAINING OF PARENT GOVERNORS.

THE ALLIANCE PLANS:

   * TO CREATE A UNITED DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, TRAINING AND SCIENCE, AND
     PUT LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF MUCH OF THE LOCAL TRAINING
     WORK OF THE MSC;
   * TO RESTORE NEGOTIATING RIGHTS TO TEACHERS AND TO CREATE A GENERAL
     TEACHING COUNCIL TO ENHANCE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS, WHICH WILL ALSO BE
     SUPPORTED BY MORE IN-SERVICE TRAINING AND APPRAISAL TO ENSURE THAT GOOD
     TEACHERS DO NOT HAVE TO LEAVE THE CLASSROOM TO BECOME ADMINISTRATORS N
     ORDER TO ACHIEVE ADEQUATE REWARDS AND STATUS;
   * TO RAISE STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS THROUGH INCREASED RESOURCES FOR BOOKS AND
     MATERIALS, DOUBLING TEACHER TRAINING IN SHORTAGE SUBJECTS SUCH AS
     MATHS, SCIENCE AND COMPUTING, THROUGH SPECIAL FUNDS FOR INNOVATION,
     THROUGH A STRONGER INSPECTORATE AND THROUGH A BROAD AND BALANCED
     CURRICULUM ESTABLISHED BY CONSENSUS PROVIDING FOR A CORE RANGE OF
     SUBJECTS TO BE STUDIED BY ALL PUPILS BUT ALLOWING FOR LOCAL NEEDS TO BE
     REFLECTED AND INNOVATION TO BE TRIED.
   * TO MAKE AVAILABLE ONE YEAR'S PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE FOR ALL
     CHILDREN;
   * TO DEVELOP THE POTENTIAL OF EACH YOUNG PERSON BY THE WIDER USE OF
     PROFILES AND RECORDS OF ACHIEVEMENT, BY DISCOURAGING EARLY
     SPECIALISATION BY REFORMING THE A-LEVEL EXAMINATION SO THAT IT COVERS A
     WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS OVER THE ARTS-SCIENCE DIVIDE, BY POSITIVE ACTION
     TO ENCOURAGE GIRLS TO TAKE UP SUBJECTS PREVIOUSLY DOMINATED BY BOYS,
     AND BY SEEKING TO BUILD ON ACHIEVEMENTS RATHER THAN MERELY PENALISING
     FAILURE;
   * TO ENABLE SCHOOLS TO HAVE FULL CHARGE OF THEIR OWN BUDGETS, AS THE
     ALLIANCE HAS DONE IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE, ENSURING THAT A FULLY
     REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNING BODY IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING THE MOST
     EFFECTIVE USE OF THE AVAILABLE MONEY;
   * TO GET RID OF ARTIFICIAL DIVISIONS AT 16 BY TAKING STEPS TOWARDS A
     SINGLE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING ALLOWANCES, REPLACING THE
     PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS WHICH MAKE YTS SCHEMES MORE FINANCIALLY ATTRACTIVE
     THAN FURTHER STUDY;
   * TO DEVELOP TERTIARY COLLEGES WHERE LOCAL CONDITIONS ARE APPROPRIATE;
   * A CRASH PROGRAMME TO OVERCOME SKILLS SHORTAGES, WITH AN EXPANSION OF
     TRAINING AND RE-TRAINING FACILITIES UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF LOCAL
     EDUCATION AUTHORITIES, GIVING REPRESENTATION TO TRAINEES IN THE
     MANAGEMENT OF SCHEMES;
   * A TRAINING INCENTIVE SCHEME TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO INCREASE THEIR
     COMMITMENT TO TRAINING; COMPANIES SPENDING ABOVE A CERTAIN QUOTA ON
     TRAINING WOULD RECEIVE A REBATE;
   * TO ENABLE THE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED TO TAKE UP VACANT PLACES N FURTHER
     AND HIGHER EDUCATION COURSES WITHOUT LOSING BENEFIT, WITH THE STUDENT
     ABLE TO LEAVE THE COURSE IMMEDIATELY A JOB BECOMES AVAILABLE;
   * TO WIDEN ACCESS TO FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION BY AN IMMEDIATE
     RESTORATION OF BENEFITS TAKEN AWAY BY THE TORIES, PLUS A 15% PHASED
     REAL IMPROVEMENT IN STUDENT SUPPORT.
   * TO RECOGNISE THAT EDUCATION IS A LIFE-LONG PROCESS, AND THAT MORE
     PEOPLE NEED TO RETURN TO IT AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF LIFE EITHER TO LEARN
     NEW SKILLS OR TO ACQUIRE BASIC SKILLS; WE WILL SEEK TO MAKE ACCESS TO
     HIGHER AND FURTHER EDUCATION FOR MATURE STUDENTS EASIER AND TO
     STRENGTHEN THOSE INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY GEARED TO THEIR
     NEEDS; THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND SHOULD BE WIDENED TO HELP IN THIS AREA;
   * TO GUARANTEE A PERIOD OF FREE FURTHER EDUCATION BASED ON OPEN
     UNIVERSITY LEVELS OF FUNDING FOR EVERYONE OVER 1 E TO BE TAKEN AT A
     TIME OF THEIR CHOICE;
   * TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN OUR UNIVERSITIES, POLYTECHNICS AND COLLEGES BY
     ACCORDING PROPER
   * RECOGNITION TO THEIR VALUE AND INCREASING SO FAR AS POSSIBLE THE
     RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM, BY EXPANDING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, WHICH
     HAS BEEN SEVERELY CUT, AND WIDENING ACCESS. WE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER
     OF STUDENTS BY 20% OVER FIVE YEARS AS A STEP TOWARDS OUR GOAL OF
     DOUBLING THE PROPORTION OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE GOING IN TO HIGHER
     EDUCATION BY THE YEAR 2000. THE HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR WOULD HAVE A
     MAJOR PART TO PLAY IN OUR CRASH PROGRAMME TO OVERCOME SKILL SHORTAGES;
     WE INTEND TO CREATE A HIGHER EDUCATION COUNCIL TO CO-ORDINATE THE
     PLANNING OF BOTH SECTORS OF HIGHER EDUCATION; WE SUPPORT CORPORATE
     STATUS FOR POLYTECHNICS BUT OPPOSE THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS TO BRING THEM
     UNDER NATIONAL CONTROL;
   * IMPROVED EDUCATION PROVISION FOR THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS, IN COLLEGES
     AS WELL AS IN SCHOOLS, BACKED BY A NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE;
   * WE RECOGNISE AND WOULD UPHOLD THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO WISH TO PAY FOR
     INDEPENDENT EDUCATION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE WOULD PHASE OUT THE
     ASSISTED PLACES SCHEME WITHOUT AFFECTING PUPILS ALREADY IN THE SCHEME,
     SO THAT MONEY WHICH HAS BEEN DIVERTED FROM THE STATE SYSTEM CAN ONCE
     AGAIN BE USED TO RAISE THE STANDARDS IN STATE SCHOOLS. WE BELIEVE THAT
     CHARITABLE TAX RELIEFS IN PRIVATE EDUCATION SHOULD ONLY GO TO GENUINELY
     PHILANTHROPIC ACTIVITIES, AND WOULD REVIEW THE WORKINGS OF CHARITY LAW
     WITH THAT OBJECT IN VIEW. WE WILL ENCOURAGE GREATER CO-OPERATION
     BETWEEN STATE AND INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS.

AN ALLIANCE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

THE ALLIANCE SEEKS TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE THEIR OWN
LIVES AND PLAY A FULL PART IN THEIR COMMUNITY. OUR POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO
PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO SPEAK OUT AND TO INCREASE THEIR
FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE.

   * WE WILL BUILD ON THE YTS TO TURN YOUTH TRAINING INTO A FULLY
     COMPREHENSIVE, HIGH QUALITY VOCATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR
     16-19 YEAR OLDS;
   * WE WILL OFFER A JOB GUARANTEE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
     UNEMPLOYED FOR OVER A YEAR;
   * OUR "RENT-A-ROOM" SCHEME WILL HELP SATISFY THE NEED, PARTICULARLY AMONG
     SINGLE, YOUNG PEOPLE, FOR RENTED ACCOMMODATION AND WILL MAKE IT EASIER
     FOR THEM TO TRAVEL TO SEEK WORK;
   * WE WILL ABOLISH THE 18-24 INCOME SUPPORT RATE SO THAT ALL SINGLE PEOPLE
     WILL RECEIVE THE SAME RATE OF PERSONAL ALLOWANCE;
   * WE WILL REVIEW THE DUTIES OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO HOUSE THE HOMELESS
     AND IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WILL AIM TO GIVE 16-18 YEAR OLDS LEAVING
     LOCAL AUTHORITY CARE, A STATUTORY RIGHT TO BE HOUSED;
   * WE WILL GET RID OF ARTIFICIAL DIVISIONS AT 16 BY TAKING STEPS TOWARDS A
     SINGLE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING ALLOWANCES, REPLACING THE
     PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS WHICH DISCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING IN
     FULL TIME EDUCATION;
   * WE WILL RESTORE STUDENT BENEFIT ENTITLEMENTS, MAKE A 15% PHASED REAL
     IMPROVEMENT IN STUDENT SUPPORT, INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME
     EQUIVALENT STUDENTS BY 140,000 (20%) IN FIVE YEARS AND DOUBLE THE
     NUMBER BY THE END OF THE CENTURY;
   * WE WILL REDUCE THE AGE OF CANDIDATURE TO EIGHTEEN TO ENABLE YOUNG
     PEOPLE TO TAKE A FULL PART IN LOCAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.

GREEN GROWTH

THERE CANNOT BE A HEALTHY ECONOMY WITHOUT A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT.

WE WILL TAKE PROPER CARE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT.

UNDER AN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT EVERY ASPECT OF POLICY WOULD BE EXAMINED FOR
ITS EFFECT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WE HOLD IN TRUST FOR FUTURE
GENERATIONS.

WE WILL ENSURE BRITAIN TAKES THE LEAD IN PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC
GROWTH AND INVESTMENT IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES DESIGNED TO REMOVE POLLUTION AND
THEREBY CREATE NEW JOB OPPORTUNITIES.

THE ALLIANCE WILL SET UP A NEW DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION HEADED
BY A CABINET MINISTER WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,
PLANNING, CONSERVATION AND POLLUTION CONTROL, AND PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL
POLICIES THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT. AMONG THE PRIORITIES OF THIS DEPARTMENT WILL
BE:

   * POWERFUL DISINCENTIVES TO POLLUTERS BASED ON TOUGHER PENALTIES AND
     IMPLEMENTATION OF A POLLUTER PAYS" PRINCIPLE FOR CLEANING UP THE DAMAGE
     BACKED BY SUPPORT FOR GOOD PRACTICE;
   * THE SAFEST POSSIBLE CONTAINMENT AND DISPOSAL FOR INDUSTRIAL WASTE, WITH
     RECYCLING WHEREVER FEASIBLE;
   * CLEAN AIR LEGISLATION SETTING NEW STANDARDS, WITH TOUGH MEASURES TO
     DEAL WITH ACID RAIN AND AN ACCELERATION OF THE PHASING OUT OF LEAD IN
     PETROL;
   * INTRODUCING A STATUTORY DUTY FOR BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR
     COMPANIES TO PUBLISH ANNUAL STATEMENTS ON THE IMPACT OF THEIR
     ACTIVITIES ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND OF THE MEASURES THEY HAVE TAKEN TO
     PREVENT, TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE THEIR IMPACT;
   * PROTECTION OF THE GREEN BELT ROUND OUR CITIES.

THE ALLIANCE IS OPPOSED TO PRIVATISATION OF THE WATER AUTHORITIES, WHICH
WOULD HAND OVER VITAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES AFFECTING RIVERS,
SEWERAGE, WATER QUALITY, POLLUTION CONTROL AND FISHERIES TO PRIVATE HANDS.
THESE FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE RESTORED TO DEMOCRATIC CONTROL.

ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

WE WILL INSTITUTE AN ENERGY POLICY WHICH MEETS THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND THE
DOMESTIC CONSUMER AND HAS FULL REGARD TO THE ENVIRONMENT. BRITAIN IS IN A
BETTER POSITION THAN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES TO DO THIS BECAUSE OF THE NATURAL
ASSETS WE HAVE. ALLIANCE ENERGY POLICY AVOIDS DEPENDENCE ON ANY SINGLE
SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND IS BASED ON:

   * MORE PRUDENT USE OF OUR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES SO THAT THEY ARE NOT
     DEPLETED TOO QUICKLY;
   * CONTINUED MODERNISATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COAL INDUSTRY, INCLUDING
     NEW COAL-FIRED POWER STATIONS WITH MEASURES TO PREVENT ACID RAIN AND
     MORE HELP TO AREAS AFFECTED BY PIT CLOSURES; THE POWER TO LICENSE COAL
     MINES WOULD BE TRANSFERRED FROM BRITISH COAL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF
     ENERGY TO PREVENT ABUSE OF MONOPOLY;
   * MUCH MORE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK ON RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES,
     INCLUDING WIND, SOLAR, WAVE AND GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; WE WILL VIGOROUSLY
     PURSUE PROPOSALS FOR TIDAL BARRAGES SUCH AS THOSE SUGGESTED FOR THE
     SEVERN AND THE MERSEY, SUBJECT TO TAKING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT INTO
     ACCOUNT;
   * FAR MORE EFFORT INTO ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION, INCLUDING
     HIGHER STANDARDS OF INSULATION IN HOMES AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF COMBINED
     HEAT AND POWER SCHEMES; NEVERTHELESS THERE WILL NEED TO BE A PROGRAMME
     OF REPLACEMENT AND DECOMMISSIONING FOR POWER STATIONS WHICH ARE
     REACHING OR HAVE REACHED THE END OF THEIR DESIGN LIVES.

EXISTING CAPACITY AND PLANNED COAL-TIRED POWER STATIONS ARE ENOUGH TO MEET
OUR NEEDS FOR SOME TIME TO COME AND WE SEE NO CASE FOR PROCEEDING WITH A PWR
AT SIZEWELL OR OTHER NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS AT THE PRESENT TIME. SAFETY MUST
COME FIRST AND AFTER CHERNOBYL THERE IS CLEARLY A NEED FOR A WIDER
INVESTIGATION INTO THE SAFETY OF NUCLEAR POWER, AND THERE IS ALSO A NEED FOR
A THOROUGH AND INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE ECONOMICS OF NUCLEAR POWER
GENERATION.

WE WILL CONTINUE RESEARCH INTO NUCLEAR FISSION POWER INCLUDING RESEARCH INTO
THE FAST BREEDER REACTOR WHICH MAY BE NEEDED IF RENEWABLE RESOURCES PROVE TO
BE LESS VIABLE THAN WE BELIEVE. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE JOINT EUROPEAN
TORUS (JET) NUCLEAR FISSION PROJECT.

THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM CONCERNING THE DISPOSAL OF NUCLEAR WASTE, AND
FURTHER STUDIES WILL BE COMMISSIONED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS SATISFACTORILY
AS POSSIBLE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS CRITICAL MATTER SHOULD BE RUSHED
AND THEREFORE ADVOCATE ON-SITE STORAGE UNTIL SUITABLE METHODS WHICH HAVE
PROVED TO BE SAFE ARE AVAILABLE.

WE WOULD ABIDE BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION (THE LONDON CONVENTION) WHICH
PROHIBITS MARINE DUMPING OF NUCLEAR WASTE.

THE ENVIRONMENT IS UNDER PARTICULAR STRESS IN TWO AREAS: THE CITIES AND THE
COUNTRYSIDE. THE ALLIANCE IS DETERMINED TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY
OF LIFE IN BOTH.

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE INNER CITIES

OUR CITIES ARE IN DANGER OF CHANGING FROM HAVING BEEN CENTRES OF INITIATIVE
AND ACTIVITY IN THE PAST INTO INDUSTRIAL DESERTS, PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR
FUTURE. THE DIVISION AND BITTERNESS IN BRITAIN THAT CONSERVATIVE NEGLECT IN
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND LABOUR CONTROL IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT
ARE SEEN AT THEIR WORST IN OUR MAJOR CITIES.

URBAN NEIGHBOURHOODS NEED TO BE NO LESS DISTINCT AND INDIVIDUAL THAN RURAL
COMMUNITIES BUT THE LABOUR AND CONSERVATIVE ATTITUDE HAS BEEN TO REGARD THE
CITY AND PARTICULARLY THE INNER CITY AS ONE HUGE PROBLEM AREA AND AS A
BATTLEGROUND FOR THE CLASS STRUGGLE. THOSE WHO LIVE THERE KNOW BETTER AND
ARE APPALLED AT THE DAMAGE INFLICTED ON THE CLOSE, CARING COMMUNITIES OF THE
PAST.

THE ALLIANCE BELIEVES THAT THE STRONG CITY CANNOT SURVIVE WITHOUT STRONG
NEIGHBOURHOODS. WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY OF THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE
INNER CITY TO RENEW THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES, BUT THEY MUST BE GIVEN THE
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TOOLS TO DO THE JOB. TOO MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO SERVE
THE INNER CITIES IN PROFESSIONAL JOBS LIVE IN SUBURBS REMOTE FROM LOCAL
PROBLEMS.

THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS WE WOULD INVEST IN
HOUSING, SCHOOLS AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO WORK IN THE
INNER CITIES TO LIVE THERE.

WE WILL MAKE ATTRACTIVE RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE AND CLOSER TO
THE CITY CENTRE TO END THE TWILIGHT GHETTOS THAT ASSIST THE MUGGER AND THE
BURGLAR.

WE WILL SUPPORT OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL PEOPLE TO WORK IN THEIR OWN
COMMUNITY, TO ESTABLISH NEW BUSINESSES THROUGH LOCAL ENTERPRISE AGENCIES AND
TO TRAIN FOR NEEDED SKILLS.

THE ALLIANCE WILL USE THE URBAN PROGRAMME TO ESTABLISH COMMUNITY CENTRES,
ENHANCE VOLUNTARY GROUPS AND ASSIST TENANTS TO MANAGE THEIR OWN ESTATES.

WE WILL PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ELECTED NEIGHBOURHOOD COUNCILS WITH
STATUTORY PARISH STATUS, WHERE THERE IS CLEAR DEMAND.

GENUINE LAW AND ORDER DEPENDS ON COMMUNITIES SUPPORTING THE POLICE IN
PREVENTING CRIME AND BEING CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO END THE ANONYMITY ON WHICH
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THRIVES.

RENEWING OUR CITIES AND ENABLING URBAN COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP A REAL SENSE
OF STABILITY AND SECURITY IS THE ONLY SOUND WAY OF PREVENTING AND DETECTING
CRIME.

PROTECTING AND ENHANCING OUR COUNTRYSIDE

THE ALLIANCE SEEKS TO PROVIDE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO LIVE AND
WORK IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, TO CHECK DECLINE AND DEPOPULATION, (ESPECIALLY OF
YOUNG PEOPLE), TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES AND TO ENCOURAGE SELF-HELP
SOLUTIONS TO RURAL PROBLEMS.

OUR AGRICULTURAL POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW FARMLAND TO REMAIN IN USE
RATHER THAN BEING SET ASIDE. HOWEVER, OUR PLANNING STRATEGY WILL ALLOW FOR
ALTERNATIVE LAND USE WHICH IS IN KEEPING WITH, AND MAKES A SENSITIVE
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LOCAL RURAL ECONOMY.

   * WE WILL GIVE STRONG SUPPORT TO THE DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION AND COSIRA,
     IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE LOCAL ENTERPRISE AND TO RE-USE EXISTING
     BUILDINGS FOR THESE PURPOSES. IN REGIONS WHERE DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ARE
     SET UP THEY WILL PROMOTE A CO-ORDINATED APPROACH TO THE RURAL ECONOMY.
     RURAL AREAS WITH SEVERE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SHOULD BE DESIGNATED TO
     RECEIVE AID FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY REGIONAL FUND;
   * WE WILL ENCOURAGE IMAGINATIVE SCHEMES TO MAINTAIN ESSENTIAL FACILITIES
     IN THE COUNTRYSIDE SUCH AS RURAL TRANSPORT, VILLAGE SCHOOLS, CALL BOXES
     AND SUB-POST OFFICES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN THREATENED UNDER THE
     CONSERVATIVES; NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES AND PRIVATISED MONOPOLIES SUCH
     AS BRITISH TELECOM SHOULD BE PLACED UNDER STRONGER OBLIGATIONS TO
     RECOGNISE RURAL NEEDS;
   * WE WILL CONSERVE OUR HERITAGE OF BUILDINGS;
   * NATIONAL PARKS, AREAS OF OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY AND GREEN BELTS
     SHOULD BE FULLY PROTECTED, WITH THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THESE AREAS
     HAVING A FULL, DEMOCRATIC VOICE IN PLANNING POLICIES AND RECOGNITION
     GIVEN OF THE ADDED PROBLEMS THEY FACE;
   * FORESTRY POLICY SHOULD PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON BROAD-LEAVED SPECIES, AND
     LARGER SCALE AFFORESTATION SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO A SPECIAL SYSTEM OF
     PLANNING CONTROLS;
   * WE OPPOSE THE PRIVATISATION OF THE FORESTRY COMMISSION.

BETTER HOUSING

HOME START

OWNING A HOME OF ONE'S OWN IS MOST PEOPLE'S DREAM BUT NOT EVERYONE CAN
AFFORD THE HIGH COST OF TAKING THE FIRST STEP. WE WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO
HOME-OWNERSHIP FOR THOUSANDS MORE THE YOUNG AND THE NOT-SO-YOUNG - TO ENABLE
THEM TO COPE WITH THE INITIAL PROBLEM, BUYING A HOME, WHEN THEIR RESOURCES
ARE MOST STRETCHED.

WE WILL BUILD ON AND CONSIDERABLY IMPROVE THE EXISTING CAPITAL HOME LOAN
SCHEME WITH A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO £1,000 FOR EVERY NEW BUYER. THIS WILL GIVE
FIRST TIME BUYERS THE BENEFIT OF LOWER MONTHLY REPAYMENTS AT THE START OF
THEIR MORTGAGES.

ALL THOSE ELIGIBLE WILL HAVE AVERAGE INCOMES FOR THE TWO PREVIOUS YEARS NOT
EXCEEDING £20,000 (JOINT) OR £10,000 (SINGLE). A CEILING WILL BE WORKED OUT,
REGION BY REGION, ON THE PRICE OF THE HOME PURCHASED, SO AS TO EXCLUDE
PEOPLE RICH ENOUGH TO BUY VERY EXPENSIVE HOMES. WE ESTIMATE THIS WILL COST
AROUND £50 MILLION PER ANNUM ONCE THE SCHEME IS FULLY UNDERWAY.

WE WILL ABOLISH STAMP DUTY ON HOUSE PURCHASES FOR EVERYONE PARTICIPATING IN
"HOME START". STAMP DUTY NOW STANDS AT 1% ON PURCHASES PRICED AT ABOVE
£30,000. ABOLITION WOULD BE WORTH AT LEAST £300 AND COULD IN THE SOUTH-EAST
BE WORTH £500 TO A FIRST-TIME BUYER.

WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO DEAL WITH HOMELESSNESS AND BAD HOUSING. HOUSING IS A
VIVID EXAMPLE OF THE CONSERVATIVES' CYNICISM. THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED THE
NARROW RULES RESTRICTING LOCAL HOUSING POWERS, CUT BACK THE CAPITAL SUMS
AVAILABLE AND IS NOW BLAMING THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITIES FOR THE HOUSING
CRISIS SUCH NATIONAL DECISIONS CAUSE. IN PARTICULAR THE RESTRICTION OF
SPENDING ON HOUSING TO ONLY 20% OF THE MONEY COMING TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES
FROM CAPITAL SALES MAKES NO FINANCIAL OR SOCIAL SENSE. WE WILL REMOVE THE
RESTRICTION.

   * WE WILL TACKLE THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS;
   * WE WILL GIVE TENANTS MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND MORE
     CHOICE;
   * WE WILL PROVIDE MORE CHOICES FOR PRIVATE TENANTS;
   * WE WILL GIVE THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO MOVE TO
     MORE SUITABLE HOUSING OR TO ADAPT THEIR PRESENT HOMES;
   * WE WILL STOP HOUSING PROBLEMS FROM RESTRICTING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES -
     IT IS NO USE GETTING "ON YOUR BIKE" TO FIND WORK IF THE ONLY AVAILABLE
     JOBS ARE IN PLACES WHERE THERE IS NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION;
   * WE WILL REQUIRE EACH HOUSING AUTHORITY TO DRAW UP A HOUSING STRATEGY TO
     DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE AREAS OF NEED AND HOW THEY CAN BEST BE MET
     WORKING WITH VOLUNTARY ORGANISATION, HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS, BUILDING
     SOCIETIES AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AS ALLIANCE GROUPS ON LOCAL COUNCILS
     ARE ALREADY DOING;
   * WE WILL OPEN UP A NEW 'PARTNERSHIP' SECTOR OF RENTED HOUSING FUNDED BY
     BUILDING SOCIETIES AND INSTITUTIONS WITH A CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
     CONTRIBUTION TO KEEP RENTS AT REASONABLE LEVELS; THESE SCHEMES WOULD BE
     RUN BY THEIR TENANTS AS CO-OPERATIVES WITH THE SUPPORT OF LOCAL
     COUNCILS AND HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS. IN THE LONG RUN WE WANT PUBLIC
     SUPPORT FOR HOUSING COSTS TO BE EVEN-HANDED BETWEEN THOSE WHO RENT AND
     THOSE WHO BUY;
   * WE WILL TARGET OUR HOUSING ASSISTANCE ON THOSE WHO MOST NEED IT. WE
     WILL PROMOTE MORTGAGE SCHEMES WHICH CAN OPEN UP HOME OWNERSHIP TO A
     WIDER VARIETY OF PEOPLE, SUCH AS INDEX-LINKED MORTGAGES AND SHARED
     OWNERSHIP; WE WILL IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY OF HOME IMPROVEMENT GRANTS
     TO HOMEOWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE FABRIC OF THEIR PROPERTIES FOR THE
     BENEFIT OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY;
   * WE WILL RETAIN THE RIGHT TO BUY. WE ALSO WISH TO GIVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES
     ENOUGH DISCRETION TO DEAL WITH LOCAL HOUSING SHORTAGES. PARLIAMENT MUST
     ENSURE THAT LIMITS ARE SET ON SUCH DISCRETION TO ENSURE THAT IT IS NOT
     USED TO DENY THE RIGHT TO BUY TO TENANTS IN GENERAL, AND THAT ANYONE
     WHO IS PRECLUDED FROM BUYING HIS OR HER PRESENT HOME IS GIVEN THE
     OPPORTUNITY TO BUY ANOTHER PROPERTY ON COMPARABLE TERMS THROUGH
     PORTABLE DISCOUNTS;
   * WE WOULD RESTORE TO COUNCILS THE RIGHT TO SPEND THE PROCEEDS OF COUNCIL
     HOUSE SALES ON REPLACING AND REPAIRING HOUSING STOCK;
   * WE WILL INSIST ON HIGHER DESIGN STANDARDS IN PUBLIC HOUSING, MORE AND
     GREATER RECOGNITION OF THE CONTRIBUTION THAT GOOD COMMUNITY
     ARCHITECTURE CAN MAKE TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND WE WANT INVESTMENT
     DIRECTED AT IMPROVING EXISTING PROPERTIES WHEREVER JUSTIFIED RATHER
     THAN DEMOLITION;
   * WE WILL INCORPORATE RIGHTS FOR COUNCIL TENANTS TO CONTROL AND IMPROVE
     THEIR HOUSES IN A STATUTORY TENANTS' CHARTER;
   * WE WILL SET UP A NATIONAL MOBILITY SCHEME COVERING ALL SECTORS OF
     HOUSING;
   * ONCE MORE HOMES ARE AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF THE ALLIANCE'S HOUSING
     STRATEGY, WE WILL EXTEND THE STATUTORY DUTY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO
     PROVIDE FOR THE HOMELESS, PHASING IN EXTENSIONS TO THE 1977 ACT
     BEGINNING WITH SINGLE PEOPLE OVER 40 AND YOUNG AGED 16-18 LEAVING CARE
     OR WHO ARE OTHERWISE HOMELESS.

RENT-A-ROOM

THERE IS A DESPERATE NEED FOR RENTED ACCOMMODATION, PARTICULARLY FOR SINGLE
PEOPLE AND COUPLES. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF OWNER-OCCUPIED HOUSES AND COUNCIL
HOUSES IN BRITAIN WITH SPARE ROOMS.

MANY ARE DETERRED FROM RENTING BY THE PRESENT RENTALS RED TAPE. ANOTHER
CRUCIAL FACTOR IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL TO SEEK WORK. WE
WILL ACT TO ENABLE OWNER-OCCUPIERS AND COUNCIL TENANTS WISHING TO LET A ROOM
IN THEIR OWN HOME TO DO SO MORE EASILY, AND TO THEIR FINANCIAL ADVANTAGE.

RENTAL INCOME UP TO £60 PER WEEK WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX OR
CAPITAL GAINS TAX.

WE WILL LEGISLATE TO INVALIDATE CLAUSES IN MORTGAGE CONTRACTS OR LOCAL
AUTHORITY LETTING CONTRACTS THAT PROHIBIT SUCH LETTINGS.

RE-POSSESSION OF SUCH ROOMS WILL BE MADE EASIER.

THE "RENT-A-ROOM" SCHEME WILL BE RESTRICTED TO OWNER-OCCUPIER, COUNCIL
TENANTS, OR TENANTS OF HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS, LETTING A MAXIMUM OF TWO ROOMS
IN THEIR HOME.

THE RENT WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET, BUT ONLY RENTAL INCOME UP TO A
TOTAL OF £60 PER WEEK WILL BE DISREGARDED BY THE INLAND REVENUE.

WE WILL LEGISLATE TO IMPOSE A DUTY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ISSUE AND
REGULARLY REVIEW LICENCES TO APPROVED AGENCIES, SUCH AS HOUSING
ASSOCIATIONS, HOUSING AID CENTRES, OR COMMERCIAL AGENCIES, IN THEIR AREA TO
OPERATE THE SCHEME. SUCH AGENCIES WILL ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH BOTH
LANDLORD AND TENANT, AND WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE LANDLORD FOR ENDING ANY
TENANCY ARRANGEMENT WITHIN A FORTNIGHT. COURT PROCEDURES WILL BE SPEEDED UP
TO ENSURE THAT POSSESSION IN ALL GENUINE CASES IS OBTAINABLE IN THAT TIME.

THE "RENT-A-ROOM" SCHEME WILL BENEFIT MANY PEOPLE.

FIRST, IT WILL HELP SINGLE PEOPLE AND COUPLES, PARTICULARLY THE YOUNG, AND
THOSE MOVING IN ORDER TO GET WORK TO FIND SUITABLE ACCOMMODATION, WHERE AT
THE MOMENT IT IS BOTH SCARCE AND EXPENSIVE.

SECOND, IT WILL HELP OWNER-OCCUPIERS, INCLUDING ELDERLY PEOPLE, TO INCREASE
THEIR INCOME, TO ASSIST WITH MORTGAGE REPAYMENTS OR WITH THE MAINTENANCE FOR
THEIR HOMES; IT SHOULD HELP SOME YOUNG FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO
BECOME HOME OWNERS FOR THE FIRST TIME.

HOME INCOME PLAN

FOR MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE THEIR ONLY CAPITAL IS THEIR HOME AND THEY DO NOT
HAVE A REGULAR INCOME. ELDERLY HOME OWNERS ON LOW INCOMES, IN FACT, ARE
BECOMING ONE OF THE MOST DEPRIVED SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE PROPORTION
IN LOW STANDARD HOMES IS DOUBLE THAT OF THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE AND MANY
OTHERS IN GOOD HOMES ARE SHORT OF SPENDING MONEY.

TO ENABLE BRITAIN'S ELDERLY HOME OWNERS TO LIVE MORE COMFORTABLE,
INDEPENDENT AND HAPPIER LIVES WE WILL INTRODUCE A TAX-ASSISTED HOME INCOME
PLAN. IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THEIR INCOME OR PROVIDE MONEY FOR
ESSENTIAL HOUSE EXPENSES AND REPAIRS.

THE HOME INCOME PLAN WILL ENABLE THEM, IF THEY CHOOSE, TO UNLOCK THE CAPITAL
VALUE OF THEIR HOMES TO MEET THEIR NEED FOR MORE INCOME NOW

THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE OUT A MORTGAGE ON PART OF THE VALUE OF THE HOUSE
AND USE IT TO BUY AN ANNUITY PROVIDING REGULAR INCOME. THE INTEREST ON THE
LOAN WILL BE ADDED TO THE CAPITAL SUM SO THAT NEITHER INTEREST NOR CAPITAL
NEED BE REPAID DURING THE BORROWER'S LIFETIME.

ALTHOUGH SEVERAL LEADING BUILDING SOCIETIES AND LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANIES
OFFER HOME INCOME PLANS AT PRESENT, THEY ARE OF LIMITED VALUE BECAUSE THE
INTEREST HAS TO BE PAID GROSS AFTER THE DEATH OF THE BORROWER. YET TAX
RELIEF IS ALLOWED IF THE BORROWERS REDUCE THEIR INCOME BY REPAYING THE
INTEREST DURING THEIR LIFETIME. NEITHER METHOD GIVES REALLY FAIR VALUE AND
SO ONLY 25,000 HOME INCOME PLANS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT.

WE WILL MAKE HOME INCOME PLANS A REALLY WORTHWHILE BENEFIT FOR OLDER PEOPLE
BY ALLOWING THEM TO POSTPONE THE INTEREST PAYMENTS AND QUALIFY FOR TAX
RELIEF WHEN THE INTEREST IS FINALLY REPAID. THIS COULD, ON LIFE ASSURANCE
INDUSTRY CALCULATIONS GIVE AN 80% BOOST TO THE INCOME OF A WOMAN IN HER
70'S.

TAX RELIEF FOR PENSIONERS AGED 70 OR OVER WHO TAKE OUT HOME INCOME PLANS
WOULD COST LESS THAN £40 MILLION, ASSUMING A 70% TAKE-UP. THE COST WOULD
TAKE TIME TO BUILD UP AND WOULD NOT BE INCURRED ALL AT ONCE.

TRANSPORT

WE WILL MAINTAIN PUBLIC TRANSPORT.

WIDER CAR OWNERSHIP HAS IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND ENHANCED THE
FREEDOM OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, WHICH WE WELCOME; AT THE SAME TIME, TRANSPORT
POLICY HAS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF CONGESTION AND ROAD SAFETY, WHICH
ARISE FROM BUSIER ROADS, AND HAS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PUBLIC TRANSPORT FOR
THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR, INCLUDING MANY WOMEN, YOUNG PEOPLE
AND THE ELDERLY. WHILE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE GREATER FREEDOM OF TRAVEL THAN
EVER BEFORE, SIGNIFICANT MINORITIES NOW HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS OPPORTUNITY
TO TRAVEL THAN PREVIOUSLY, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS AND SOME OUTLYING
HOUSING ESTATES.

THE ALLIANCE BELIEVES THAT:

   * DEREGULATION OF BUS SERVICES UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES WAS BOTCHED. BUS
     SERVICES COULD ONLY SURVIVE IF THEY PAID FOR THEMSELVES, LEAVING MANY
     ELDERLY PEOPLE AND SINGLE-PARENT FAMILIES ISOLATED IN THEIR OWN HOMES.
     THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTS COMPREHENSIVE COMPETITIVE TENDERING FOR A NETWORK
     OF NECESSARY BUS SERVICES, WITH LOCAL COUNCILS INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND
     FINANCING THEM. THIS COMBINES GREATER ENTERPRISE AND NEW IDEAS WITH
     MORE CARE FOR DEPRIVED GROUPS AND AREAS. LOCAL COUNCILS AND TRANSPORT
     AUTHORITIES SHOULD USE THEIR SUBSIDY POWERS TO ENSURE THAT ESSENTIAL
     SERVICES ARE MAINTAINED AND THAT PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN CITIES IS
     ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH TO REDUCE CONGESTION RESULTING FROM COMMUTING BY CAR;
   * WE WILL UNDERTAKE A MAJOR RENEWAL OF ROAD, RAIL AND PORT INFRASTRUCTURE
     AS PART OF OUR PROGRAMME OF MEASURES TO TACKLE UNEMPLOYMENT; WE WILL
     BUILD MORE BY-PASSES AND A DESIGNATED NATIONAL HEAVY LORRY NETWORK TO
     GET MORE OF THE VEHICLES OUT OF THE TOWNS, VILLAGES AND RESIDENTIAL
     AREAS;
   * WE WILL SUPPORT INVESTMENT IN OUR RAIL NETWORK BOTH TO ENCOURAGE THE
     TRANSFER OF FREIGHT FROM ROAD TO RAIL AND TO ENSURE THAT THE NATIONS
     AND REGIONS OF BRITAIN ALL SHARE IN THE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OF THE
     CHANNEL FIXED LINK.

THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT HAS PRESIDED OVER A DECLINE IN OUR MERCHANT
FLEET WHICH THREATENS OUR NATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SECURITY INTEREST. WE WOULD
ENTRUST THE LEAD ROLE IN CO-ORDINATING MARITIME POLICY TO A SENIOR MEMBER OF
THE CABINET; AND WE WOULD SEEK TO HELP THE INDUSTRY THROUGH THE PRESENT
CRISIS BY POSITIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND A DETERMINATION TO ENSURE FAIR PLAY
IN WORLD SHIPPING MARKETS.

ARTS, BROADCASTING AND RECREATION

WE WILL ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY THE ARTS AND
PHYSICAL RECREATION AND TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN POTENTIAL THROUGH THESE
ACTIVITIES. TO HELP ACHIEVE THIS AIM WE WILL DOUBLE ARTS FUNDING WITHIN THE
LIFETIME OF ONE PARLIAMENT.

THE ALLIANCE WILL SET UP A UNIFIED MINISTRY, HEADED BY A CABINET MINISTER,
TO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ARTS, BROADCASTING, FILMS, PUBLISHING,
LEISURE AND RECREATION - THESE ACTIVITIES ARE AT PRESENT SCATTERED AMONGST
MINISTRIES WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE OF MINOR SIGNIFICANCE AND ARE SUBJECT TO
CONTROL RATHER THAN ENHANCEMENT;

WE WILL FURTHER DECENTRALISE FUNDING FOR THE ARTS, CHANNELLING IT THROUGH
ENHANCED REGIONAL ARTS ASSOCIATIONS AND THE SCOTTISH AND WELSH ARTS
COUNCILS;

WHEREVER POSSIBLE WE WILL REPLACE GRANTS WITH ENDOWMENT TRUSTS PROVIDING
GREATER STABILITY AND INDEPENDENCE FOR THE ARTS WITH A MIX OF PUBLIC AND
PRIVATE FUNDING;

WE WILL CO-OPERATE WITH ARTISTS TO ACHIEVE BETTER DEALS THROUGH STRONGER
COPYRIGHT AND PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT LAWS;

WE REGARD THE BBC WORLD SERVICE, THE BRITISH COUNCIL AND THE PROVISION OF
EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS AS VERY EFFECTIVE CULTURAL
AMBASSADORS AND WE WILL ENSURE THAT INCREASED FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO CARRY
OUT THAT TASK;

WE WILL SECURE THE MAXIMUM ACCESS TO SPORTS FACILITIES FOR THE WHOLE
COMMUNITY.

ANIMALS

WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE PROTECTION OF ANIMALS.

A CIVILISED SOCIETY TREATS ANIMALS WITH CARE AND COMPASSION. AN ALLIANCE
GOVERNMENT WILL THEREFORE SET UP AN ANIMAL PROTECTION COMMISSION WHICH WILL
CONSIDERABLY IMPROVE CONTROL OVER THE WELFARE OF ANIMALS IN LABORATORIES,
FARMS, ZOOS, SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND CIRCUSES, AS WELL AS DOMESTIC AND WILD
ANIMALS, AND AT A REDUCED COST, BY UNIFYING ALL EXISTING GOVERNMENT
RESPONSIBILITIES IN THIS FIELD. THE COMMISSION WILL BE GIVEN EXTENSIVE
POWERS TO ADVISE, INSPECT AND ENFORCE LEGISLATION, AND TO REVIEW THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH CRUELTY, IN PARTICULAR
POLICE ENTRY POWERS AND THE POWER OF THE COURTS. THE COMMISSION WILL INCLUDE
FAIR REPRESENTATION FROM ANIMAL WELFARE ORGANISATIONS AS WELL AS USERS.

BRITAIN, EUROPE AND THE WORLD

THE ALLIANCE WILL ENSURE THAT BRITAIN'S FOREIGN AND DEFENCE POLICIES HELP TO
BRING A FAIRER AND SAFER WORLD. THE THINGS WE WANT TO ACHIEVE N OUR OWN
COUNTRY WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE UNLESS WE CO-OPERATE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES TO
ACHIEVE A FAIRER AND SAFER WORLD. OUR CONCERN THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BASIC
HUMAN RIGHTS AND A DECENT LIFE CANNOT STOP AT THE CHANNEL. THE HUGE PUBLIC
SUPPORT FOR FAMINE RELIEF, THE VIGOROUS PUBLIC DEBATES ON PEACE AND DEFENCE
AND THE PUBLIC COMPASSION FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM OPPRESSION IN MANY PARTS
OF THE WORLD REFUTE THE NARROW-MINDED VIEW THAT WORLD AFFAIRS ARE NOT AN
ELECTION ISSUE IN BRITAIN.

OUR AIMS

THE ALLIANCE IS FIRMLY INTERNATIONALIST. OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERNATIONAL
CO-OPERATION HAVE BEEN THROWN AWAY BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE POST-WAR YEARS,
WHEN BRITAIN NEEDED TO DEVELOP A NEW ROLE AND NEW RELATIONSHIPS IN A CHANGED
WORLD.

WE SEE THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AS BEING BOUND UP WITH THE FUTURE OF
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. AS AN ENTHUSIASTIC AND COMMITTED MEMBER OF THAT
COMMUNITY BRITAIN CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC
DECISIONS.

BRITAIN IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND SHOULD BE USING THAT
POSITION TO DEVELOP CONCERTED POLICIES ON ERADICATING HUNGER AND ON ISSUES
SUCH AS SOUTH AFRICA AND NAMIBIA, YET MRS. THATCHER HAS MADE SUCH AGREEMENT
IMPOSSIBLE AND TREATS RESPECTED COMMONWEALTH LEADERS WITH DISDAIN.

BRITAIN SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD IN SEEKING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON
SELECTIVE, TARGETED SANCTIONS, BACKED BY HELP FOR THE FRONT LINE STATES, AS
A MEANS OF INCREASING THE PRESSURE FOR AN END TO APARTHEID N SOUTH AFRICA.

BRITAIN SHOULD HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY MATURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TO MAKE CLEAR WHERE BRITISH FOREIGN
POLICY DEPARTS FROM THAT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE DAY. THE BRITISH PRIME
MINISTER SHOULD DISAVOW SUCH VENTURES AS THE BOMBING OF LIBYA AND SUPPORT
FOR THE CONTRAS, AS SO MANY AMERICANS DO, RATHER THAN ALLYING WITH THE MOST
CONSERVATIVE FORCES IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

ON DEFENCE AND DISARMAMENT, BRITAIN SHOULD BE FIRMLY COMMITTED TO THE
ACHIEVEMENT OF MULTILATERAL DISARMAMENT AND FIRM IN OUR ACCEPTANCE OF OUR
RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS COLLECTIVE SECURITY THROUGH NATO: THE ALLIANCE
REJECTS THE ONE-SIDED APPROACH WHICH CHARACTERISES BOTH THE ESCALATION OF
OUR PRESENT NUCLEAR CAPACITY THROUGH TRIDENT AND LABOUR'S DECISION TO REMOVE
ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS FROM BRITISH SOIL WITHOUT SECURING THE REMOVAL OF THOSE
WEAPONS WHICH COULD THREATEN US.

THE ALLIANCE BELIEVES THAT BRITAIN SHOULD TAKE A LEAD IN SEEKING
INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO TACKLE THE BASIC PROBLEMS OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES
OF THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY THE BURDEN OF DEBT WHICH IS CRIPPLING THEIR
EFFORTS TO FEED THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND THE NEED TO GET A FAIRER SYSTEM OF
INTERNATIONAL TRADE WHICH IS NOT BIASED AGAINST THE POORER COUNTRIES.

EUROPE

THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY MUST BE THE BASIS OF A UNITED EUROPE WHICH HAS COMMON
POLICIES ON TRADE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY, AND ENCOURAGES EUROPE'S
SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT. WE BELIEVE LABOUR'S NEGATIVE ATTITUDE
TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, AND THE OBSTRUCTIVENESS OF MRS. THATCHER'S
GOVERNMENT, NOT LEAST IN VETOING THE PROPOSED EUROPEAN COMMUNITY PROGRAMME
FOR CO-ORDINATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, IS SHORT-SIGHTED AND
UNCONSTRUCTIVE. IN A WORLD OF SUPER-POWERS, EUROPE HAS TO SPEAK WITH A
UNITED VOICE.

THE ALLIANCE WOULD:-

   * ENSURE FAIR ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT BY PROPORTIONAL
     REPRESENTATION TO GIVE PROPER RIGHTS TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY;
   * SEEK REFORM OF THE COMMUNITY'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS SO THAT THE
     BUREAUCRACY IS PROPERLY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, AND
     THAT THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS SHARES POWER EFFECTIVELY WITH THE
     PARLIAMENT;
   * WORK FOR REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY SO THAT IT NO LONGER
     DOMINATES THE COMMUNITY BUDGET, AND TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY POLICIES ON
     REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, SOCIAL AND EMPLOYMENT ISSUES;
   * SUPPORT EUROPEAN INITIATIVES TO PUT EFFORT AND RESOURCES INTO
     DEVELOPING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY; WE WOULD ACCEPT THE NEGOTIATED EUROPEAN
     COMMUNITY CO-ORDINATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME;
   * MAKE IT EASIER FOR COMPANIES TO SELL THROUGHOUT EUROPE;
   * EXTEND THE COMMON RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP IN EUROPE.

GLOBAL CO-OPERATION

AN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT WILL:

   * INCREASE BRITISH SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS, DEVELOP ITS CAPACITY
     FOR PEACEKEEPING, RESTORE BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF UNESCO AND INCREASE
     BRITISH BACKING FOR THE UN AGENCIES SUCH AS THE HIGH COMMISSION FOR
     REFUGEES;
   * DEVELOP COMMONWEALTH AND EUROPEAN CO-OPERATION ON A WIDE RANGE OF
     ISSUES, INCLUDING SANCTIONS AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA DESIGNED TO INCREASE
     PRESSURE FOR AN END TO APARTHEID AND PEACEFUL CHANGE BEFORE WAR BECOMES
     INEVITABLE; WE ARE ALSO DETERMINED TO END SOUTH AFRICA'S ILLEGAL
     OCCUPATION OF NAMIBIA;
   * INCREASE EFFORTS THROUGH INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION TO DEAL WITH THE
     THREAT OF TERRORISM.

PEACE AND SECURITY

WE WILL PROMOTE DISARMAMENT WHILE MAINTAINING SOUND DEFENCE.

EVERYTHING WE PRIZE MOST HIGHLY COULD BE THREATENED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF
OUR FREEDOM THROUGH ARMED INTERVENTION OR THREAT, OR BY THE DESTRUCTION OF A
WORLD WHICH NOW CONTAINS A MASSIVE ARSENAL OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. BUT AT LONG
LAST THERE IS NOW AN OPPORTUNITY TO HALT THE ARMS RACE. THE ALLIANCE IS
DETERMINED TO COMBINE SOUND DEFENCE AGAINST ANY POSSIBLE THREAT WITH
DETERMINED EFFORTS TO REDUCE AND EVEN REMOVE THE MASSIVE NUCLEAR STOCKPILE,
WHICH CAUSES INCREASING ANXIETY TO THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD. NEW
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ARMS AGREEMENTS ARE BEING OPENED UP BY THE CHANGED
PRIORITIES OF A NEW SOVIET LEADERSHIP: WE CANNOT AFFORD TO ASSUME THAT THIS
NEW AND WELCOME TREND IN MOSCOW WILL CONTINUE UNCHECKED, BUT AT THIS
DELICATE AND HOPEFUL STAGE IT IS VITAL THAT WE HAVE A BRITISH GOVERNMENT
DETERMINED TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE SENSIBLE BARGAINS ON ARMS
CONTROL WHICH ARE SECURE BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEN ON EACH SIDE AS BEING
REALISTIC. BRITAIN CANNOT DEFEND ITSELF OR THE VALUES OF WESTERN DEMOCRACY
ALONE, JUST AS IT CANNOT ACHIEVE INTERNATIONAL DISARMAMENT SOLELY BY ITS OWN
ACTIONS: BOTH THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE CHOSEN IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO IGNORE THE
REALITY THAT OUR DEFENCE AND DISARMAMENT EFFORTS ARE INTERDEPENDENT WITH
THOSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

THE ALLIANCE IS COMMITTED TO NATO, AND WE ACCEPT THE OBLIGATIONS OF NATO,
INCLUDING THE PRESENCE OF ALLIED BASES AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON BRITISH SOIL
ON THE BASIS OF CLEAR ARRANGEMENTS FOR A BRITISH VETO OVER THEIR OPERATIONS
INCLUDING WHERE APPROPRIATE, DUAL-KEY SYSTEMS; WE BELIEVE IT IS ESSENTIAL TO
STRENGTHEN THE EUROPEAN CONTRIBUTION TO NATO.

THE ALLIANCE WELCOMED THE OUTLINE AGREEMENT DISCUSSED AT REYKJAVIK TO REMOVE
ALL INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR WEAPONS FROM EUROPE, AND MR GORBACHEV'S LATER
ACCEPTANCE THAT SUCH A DEAL SHOULD NOT BE LINKED TO THE FUTURE OF THE US
STRATEGIC DEFENCE INITIATIVE; THE ALLIANCE BELIEVES THAT THIS MUST BE ONLY
THE FIRST, VITAL STEP IN A CONTINUING PROCESS WHICH WILL INCLUDE BOTH
SHORTER-RANGE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND CONVENTIONAL FORCES.

THE ALLIANCE WOULD WITHDRAW UK SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT REAGAN'S STRATEGIC
DEFENCE INITIATIVE, WHICH CLEARLY INVOLVES BREACHING THE ABM TREATY, IS
DESTABILISING AND IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO FURTHER ESCALATION.

WE WILL SEEK TO REVIVE NEGOTIATIONS ON A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN. IN THE
MEANTIME BRITAIN SHOULD ITSELF BAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING AND SHOULD
ENCOURAGE THE US TO DO LIKEWISE.

WE WOULD SEEK A BATTLEFIELD-NUCLEAR-WEAPON-FREE ZONE IN CENTRAL EUROPE
EXTENDING 150KM IN EACH DIRECTION FROM THE EAST-WEST DIVIDE.

WE BELIEVE THAT NATO RELIES TOO HEAVILY ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT ALL LEVELS FOR
DETERRENCE. A STRENGTHENED EUROPEAN PILLAR, INVOLVING EFFECTIVE DEFENCE
CO-OPERATION AND IMPROVED CONVENTIONAL STRENGTH WOULD BETTER ENABLE WESTERN
EUROPE TO MOVE TOWARDS THE ELIMINATION OF DEPENDENCE ON FIRST USE OF NUCLEAR
WEAPONS. NATO SHOULD ADOPT STRATEGIES AND WEAPONS WHICH ARE MORE
SELF-EVIDENTLY DEFENSIVE IN INTENT AND WHICH ARE CONCERNED WITH MINIMUM
DETERRENCE.

WE WANT TO SEE A NEW INITIATIVE ACHIEVE MUTUAL AND BALANCED FORCE REDUCTIONS
AND WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO INCLUDE BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN DISARMAMENT
NEGOTIATIONS.

WE WOULD CONTINUE BRITAIN'S EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A MULTILATERAL TREATY
PROHIBITING THE MANUFACTURE, DEVELOPMENT AND POSSESSION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
IN THE MEANTIME, WE WOULD OPPOSE ANY MANUFACTURE OF FRESH STOCKS OF CHEMICAL
OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.

IN GOVERNMENT WE WOULD MAINTAIN, WITH WHATEVER NECESSARY MODERNISATION, OUR
MINIMUM NUCLEAR DETERRENT UNTIL IT CAN BE NEGOTIATED AWAY, AS PART OF A
GLOBAL ARMS NEGOTIATION PROCESS, IN RETURN FOR WORTHWHILE CONCESSIONS BY THE
USSR WHICH WOULD ENHANCE BRITISH AND EUROPEAN SECURITY. IN ANY SUCH
MODERNISATION WE WOULD MAINTAIN OUR CAPABILITY IN THE SENSE OF FREEZING OUR
CAPACITY AT A LEVEL NO GREATER THAN THAT OF THE POLARIS SYSTEM. WE WOULD
CANCEL TRIDENT BECAUSE OF ITS EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF WARHEADS AND MEGATONNAGE,
HIGH COST AND CONTINUED DEPENDENCE ON US TECHNOLOGY. WE WOULD ASSIGN OUR
MINIMUM DETERRENT TO NATO AND SEEK EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE EUROPEAN
CO-OPERATION ON PROCUREMENT AND STRATEGIC QUESTIONS.

WE WOULD SEEK TO REDUCE THE FLOW OF ARMS TO AREAS OF CONFLICT AND TO ENSURE
THAT ARMS FROM BRITAIN ARE NOT SUPPLIED TO REPRESSIVE REGIMES, PARTICULARLY
FOR THEIR INTERNAL SECURITY OPERATIONS.

SHARED EARTH

THE ALLIANCE WILL:-

   * INCREASE THE SHARE OF BRITAIN'S GNP WHICH GOES IN DEVELOPMENT AID,
     WHICH HAS GONE DOWN FROM 0.52% TO 0.33% UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES, SO
     THAT WE REACH THE UN TARGET OF 0.7% BY THE END OF A FIVE-YEAR
     PARLIAMENT;
   * CONCENTRATE AID ON RAISING THE LIVING STANDARDS OF THE POOREST THROUGH
     MORE RURAL DEVELOPMENT, ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE,
     PROMOTION OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY, RECOGNITION OF THE ROLE OF WOMEN,
     APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY, TRAINING AND EDUCATION, MAKING FULL USE OF
     EXPERIENCE AND EXPERT VOLUNTARY AGENCIES;
   * SEEK TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF DEVELOPMENT ISSUES THROUGH MORE RESOURCES
     BEING DEVOTED TO DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION;
   * CHANGE THE SITUATION IN WHICH MANY POOR COUNTRIES PAY MORE IN DEBT
     REPAYMENTS TO RICH COUNTRIES THAN THEY RECEIVE IN AID BY SEEKING
     INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON DEBT RESCHEDULING AND CANCELLATION;
   * COMBINE THE AID-TRADE PROVISION AND THE OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT
     ADMINISTRATION'S "SOFT-LOAN" FACILITY WITH THE OVERSEAS PROJECTS
     DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY AND THE EXPORT CREDIT
     GUARANTEE DEPARTMENT INTO ONE DIVISION OF THE DTI - HELP TO BRITISH
     INDUSTRY WILL NO LONGER BE TAKEN FROM THE AID BUDGET.

CONCLUSION

THE ALLIANCE CAME INTO BEING TO ACHIEVE THESE THINGS. FROM THREE SOURCES
CAME THE POLITICAL IDEAS AND MOMENTUM WHICH ARE NOW CARRYING THE ALLIANCE
FORWARD. ONE WAS LIBERALISM, A LONG AND HONOURED POLITICAL TRADITION FROM
WHICH WE DRAW NOT ONLY THE PHILOSOPHY OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM BUT ALSO A
RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MODERN WELFARE STATE AND
THE CHAMPIONING OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE SDP COMBINES A COMMITMENT TO
SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ENDING POVERTY WITH A DYNAMIC APPROACH TO WEALTH CREATION
AND ITS LEADERS HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE OF GOVERNMENT. A THIRD ELEMENT,
WHICH HAS ENSURED THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE ALLIANCE IS INFINITELY GREATER
THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS, IS THE SUPPORT OF THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER BEFORE
BEEN MEMBERS OF A POLITICAL PARTY, BECAUSE NO PARTY SEEMED TO OFFER THEM THE
CHANCE TO REALISE THEIR AIMS. THEIR NUMBERS CONTINUE TO GROW.

THE ALLIANCE IS THEREFORE DIFFERENT. IT INVOLVES TWO POLITICAL PARTIES
WORKING TOGETHER, AND TAKING ALONG WITH THEM THE GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE WHO
ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE POLITICS OF RECENT YEARS, THE KIND OF POLITICS
WHICH IS SO DISMALLY DISPLAYED IN THE SHOUTING MATCH OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
AT PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTION TIME. ALL POLITICAL PARTIES INVOLVE COMPROMISES
BETWEEN DIFFERENT VIEWS AND DIFFERENT STRANDS OF OPINION - THE LABOUR AND
CONSERVATIVE PARTIES EACH EMBRACE AN ENORMOUSLY WIDE RANGE OF OPINION. BUT
FOR THEM THE SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE, IF IT OPERATES AT ALL, HAS TO BE
CONCEALED, KEPT WITHIN THE PARTY AND DENIED IN PUBLIC. WE MAKE NO SECRET OF
THE FACT THAT OUR PROGRAMME DRAWS ON THE IDEAS OF OUR TWO PARTIES AND THAT
WE ARE KEEN TO WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE SHARED GOALS. LIKE THE OTHERS WE
SEEK TO PUT OUR ENTIRE PROGRAMME FORWARD FOR ENDORSEMENT AND TO FORM A
MAJORITY ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT, BUT UNLIKE THE OTHERS THE WHOLE APPROACH OF
THE ALLIANCE UNDERLINES OUR BELIEF THAT IF WE ARE IN A BALANCED PARLIAMENT
WE MUST HEED THE MESSAGE OF THE VOTERS AND WORK WITH THE OTHER PARTIES TO
SEEK AN AGREED PROGRAMME WHICH COMMANDS THE WIDEST POSSIBLE SUPPORT.

THE ALLIANCE IS DIFFERENT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE VOICE OF ANY ONE
SECTION OR INTEREST. IT IS NOT PAID FOR AND CONTROLLED BY THE TRADE UNION
MOVEMENT, AS IS THE LABOUR PARTY, AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THE MASSIVE
DEPENDENCE WHICH THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE ON THE CITY AND BIG BUSINESS. THESE
LINKS MAKE EACH OF THE OTHER PARTIES POWERLESS TO REFORM THEIR OWN
INSTITUTIONAL BACKERS AND INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING OR WINNING THE
CONFIDENCE OF THEIR INSTITUTIONAL OPPONENTS. THE ALLIANCE HAS A CAPACITY TO
BE FAIR WHICH IS BASED ON ITS INDEPENDENCE AND ON THE BREADTH OF ITS
SUPPORT, TYPIFIED BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WIN BY-ELECTIONS IN
THE HEART OF THE COUNTRYSIDE IN A FORMER CONSERVATIVE STRONGHOLD IN RYEDALE
AND IN A FORMER LABOUR STRONGHOLD IN GREENWICH, BOTH SEATS NOW HELD BY
LIBERAL AND SDP WOMEN MPS.

THE ALLIANCE IS DIFFERENT IN ANOTHER RESPECT. IT IS NOT MERELY SEEKING TO
BECOME THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY, BUT TO OVERHAUL THE SYSTEM OF
GOVERNMENT SO THAT ALL FUTURE GOVERNMENTS, OF WHATEVER PARTY, ARE BASED ON
REAL PUBLIC CONSENT AND FULL PARTICIPATION IN AN OPEN SOCIETY. OUR INTENTION
IS NOT SIMPLY TO GET INTO THE DRIVING SEAT BUT TO RE-DESIGN THE VEHICLE.
ONCE THE ALLIANCE HAS REFORMED THE VOTING SYSTEM, NO FUTURE GOVERNMENT WILL
BE AWARDED THE POWER OF A MAJORITY WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF A MAJORITY OF THE
PEOPLE, AND NO KIND OF EXTREMISM, WHETHER OF THE LEFT OR OF THE RIGHT, WILL
BE ABLE TO GET IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR. NOT ONLY THAT - IF WE FIND
OURSELVES EXERCISING POWER IN A PARLIAMENT WITH NO OVERALL MAJORITY, WE
GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL USE THAT POWER TO BLOCK EXTREMISM AND TO FIGHT FOR
THE KIND OF REFORMS WHICH MAKE SURE THAT GOVERNMENTS CANNOT PUSH PEOPLE
AROUND AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE MEANS TO ACHIEVE THEIR
FULL POTENTIAL.

THE ALLIANCE IS DIFFERENT TOO, IN ITS BELIEF ABOUT THE NATURE OF SOCIETY.
OUR AIM IS A CIVILISED SOCIETY IN WHICH INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM GOES HAND-IN-HAND
WITH CARE FOR OTHERS. INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IS CENTRAL TO OUR BELIEFS, BUT IF
IT IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IT BECOMES FREEDOM ONLY FAR
THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT, OR THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. BUT WHEN SOCIETY AS
A WHOLE TRIES TO MEET HUMAN NEEDS IT MUST RESPECT INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND BE
AWARE OF THE DANGERS AND LIMITATIONS OF STATE PROVISION, OTHERWISE THERE
WILL BE NO FREEDOM, AND PUBLIC SERVICES WILL BE BOTH INHUMAN AND
INEFFICIENT. DECLINING PUBLIC SERVICES AND THE INHUMAN SCALE OF
ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE DHSS AND THE BIG COUNCIL HOUSING DEPARTMENTS HAVE
CONTRIBUTED TO A WIDESPREAD FEELING OF APATHY AND DESPAIR, AND MANY YOUNG
PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR FEEL THAT THIS SOCIETY HAS NO PLACE FOR THEM AND DOES
NOT WANT TO LISTEN TO THEM. GOVERNMENT MUST WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PEOPLE,
ENABLING THEM TO USE THEIR OWN ORGANISATIONS, THEIR OWN LOCAL COMMUNITIES
AND THEIR OWN SKILLS, AND GIVING THEM EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OVER
THOSE SERVICES WHICH CAN ONLY BE PROVIDED BY THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. OUR
SOCIETY IS ONE THAT RECOGNISES THAT THE ARTS ARE NOT AN OPTIONAL EXTRA, TO
BE GRUDGINGLY AFFORDED WHEN THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, BUT PLAY AN ESSENTIAL
PART IN MEETING THE WIDER NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND IN BROADENING THE VISION
OF COMMUNITIES. OUR AIM IS A SOCIETY IN WHICH VALUES OTHER THAN THE PURELY
ECONOMIC ARE RECOGNISED AND VALUED. OUR SOCIETY IS ONE THAT RECOGNISES THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE LIVE - EVEN THOSE WHO ARE
SUCCESSFUL DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN A SHODDY SOCIETY WHOSE VALUES ARE
DOMINATED BY GREED AND SELFISHNESS. WE RECOGNISE THE CRUCIAL NEED TO LIVE IN
HARMONY WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT AND WE WILL SUPPORT THOSE DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR
INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY ENHANCING AND
BENIGN. WE AIM TO JOIN THE NATIONS WHICH LEAD THE FIELD IN ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION INSTEAD OF TRAILING AMONGST THE LAST,

THE ALLIANCE IS ALSO DIFFERENT IN BEING CONCERNED ABOUT BOTH UNEMPLOYMENT
AND INFLATION. THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONCENTRATES ALL ITS ATTENTION ON
INFLATION AND IGNORES UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. THE LABOUR PARTY
CONCENTRATES ALL ITS ATTENTION ON UNEMPLOYMENT AND IGNORES THE FACT THAT
INCREASED INFLATION UNDERMINES EXPANSION AND INEVITABLY PUTS BRAKES ON
EFFORTS TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. WE MUST HAVE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. THAT IS
WHY OUR PROPOSALS FOR EXPANDING THE ECONOMY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY PLANS FOR AN
INCOMES STRATEGY AND FOR A FIRM MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE DISCIPLINE
THROUGH ENTRY TO THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM OF THE EUROPEAN MONETARY
SYSTEM. BUT IN THE LONG TERM WE WILL ONLY SUCCEED IF WE GIVE THE TOP
PRIORITY TO INDUSTRY. THE SERVICE AND MANUFACTURING SECTORS OF INDUSTRY ARE
MUTUALLY DEPENDENT, BUT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY HAS BEEN DEVASTATED IN RECENT
YEARS. WE BELIEVE IT IS THE ENGINE OF GROWTH AND OUR COMPETITORS IN JAPAN,
IN GERMANY AND IN THE US DEMONSTRATE THAT ONLY TOO WELL,

MUCH OF WHAT THE ALLIANCE WANTS TO DO TO ENSURE BASIC STANDARDS IN THE
PUBLIC SERVICES AND TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO FIND NEW WAYS OF CARING FOR ONE
ANOTHER DEPEND ON ACHIEVING SUCCESS THROUGH OUR ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL
POLICIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ENABLE US TO ACHIEVE GREATER PROSPERITY.
SOME OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE EARNED THE
RESOURCES WITH WHICH TO DO IT. WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO ENTER AN ELECTORAL
AUCTION SEEING WHO CAN MAKE THE LARGEST BIDS TO SPEND MONEY WHICH IS NOT
THERE AND WILL NOT BE THERE UNLESS TAXES AND BORROWING ARE INCREASED TO
UNREASONABLE AND IMPRUDENT LEVELS. INVESTMENT IN INDUSTRY AND PARTICULARLY
IN NEW AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IS THE KEY TO CREATING THE WEALTH WE ALL
WANT. WE DEPLORE THE WAY IN WHICH WINDFALL BENEFITS SUCH AS OIL REVENUES AND
THE PROCEEDS FROM PRIVATISATION HAVE BEEN FRITTERED AWAY INSTEAD OF BEING
USED TO ENHANCE THE BASIC FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY.

THE OTHER PARTIES KNOW THAT THE ALLIANCE IS DIFFERENT, AND THEY FEAR IT,
EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF BURYING THEIR OWN FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENTS WITH EACH
OTHER SO AS TO CO-OPERATE AGAINST US. IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THEY HAVE
VOTED TOGETHER AGAINST ELECTORAL REFORM, AND AGAINST SOME OF THE MEASURES
DESIGNED TO PUT TRADES UNIONS FULLY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THEIR MEMBERS. THEY
WORK WITH EACH OTHER IN AN ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE THE APPEARANCE OF A TWO-PARTY
SYSTEM LONG AFTER IT IS DEAD: CONSERVATIVES CAREFULLY PROTECT LABOUR'S
PRIVILEGES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO ENSURE THAT LATTERLY ONLY LABOUR AND
CONSERVATIVE WORKING PEERS HAVE BEEN APPOINTED TO THE LORDS, IN VAIN HOPE OF
SILENCING THE ALLIANCE VOICE. WE DO NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT AFTER
THE NEXT ELECTION THERE COULD BE AN INFORMAL "LAB-CON PACT" TO KEEP THE
ALLIANCE OUT, AS THERE HAS BEEN ON SEVERAL LOCAL COUNCILS: IT WOULD BE THE
OLD PARTIES WAY OF ATTEMPTING TO STAGGER ON AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED AFTER
THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM HAD SUFFERED A SHATTERING DEFEAT. INDEED WE BELIEVE
THAT LABOUR AND CONSERVATIVE SUPPORTERS SHOULD NOW BE ASKING THEIR
CANDIDATES "IN A BALANCED PARLIAMENT WILL YOU WORK WITH THE ALLIANCE OR WITH
OUR TRADITIONAL OPPONENTS?"

THAT IS WHY OUR PRIME AIM IS AN ALLIANCE MAJORITY GOVERNMENT, AN AIM THAT
CAN CERTAINLY BE REALISED AT THIS ELECTION. INDEED, SUCH ARE THE ABSURDITIES
OF THE VOTING SYSTEM THAT QUITE SMALL INCREASES IN ALLIANCE SUPPORT CAN MAKE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIFTY ALLIANCE SEATS AND THREE HUNDRED. IF WE GET
THAT MAJORITY WE WILL AT ONCE SET OUT TO REFORM THE SYSTEM WHICH PRODUCED
IT. OUR COMMITMENT TO FAIR ELECTIONS IS CLEAR. WE ARE THE ONLY POLITICAL
GROUPING WHO, IF GIVEN A MAJORITY, WOULD USE THAT MAJORITY POWER FORTHWITH
TO REFORM THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH WE GAINED IT. BUT WE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO
GET ON WITH THE JOB OF BRINGING DOWN UNEMPLOYMENT WHILE MANAGING THE ECONOMY
ON A SOUND BASIS SO AS TO PREVENT INFLATION FROM INCREASING DRAMATICALLY
AGAIN. WE WILL BE ABLE TO EMBARK ON IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS IN BASIC SERVICES
LIKE EDUCATION AND HEALTH, WHILE WE OPEN THE WAY TO THE LONGER-TERM
PROPOSALS IN THESE AND OTHER FIELDS WHICH WILL GIVE PEOPLE MORE CHANCE TO
REALISE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND BUILD A CARING COMMUNITY. WE WILL BE ABLE
THROUGH OUR TAX AND BENEFIT PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE THE LOT OF THOSE WHO NOW
FIND THEMSELVES ON OR NEAR THE POVERTY LINE. WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE THE
CONSERVATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT A PRIORITY OF GOVERNMENT, AND PAY SPECIAL
ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF CITIES AND COUNTRYSIDE. WE WILL BE ABLE TO HOUSE
MANY OF THE HOMELESS THROUGH MORE IMAGINATIVE HOUSING POLICIES INVOLVING
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HOUSING. WE WILL PURSUE POLICIES ON
DEFENCE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS WHICH WILL MAKE BRITAIN A FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE
WORLD, RECOGNISING OUR INTERDEPENDENCE WITH OTHER NATIONS.

ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE, AND OUR JOINT PROGRAMME SETS OUT THE MAIN STEPS WE
WILL TAKE. THESE AIMS AND VALUES ARE ALSO A CLEAR GUIDE TO THE WAY WE WOULD
USE THE POWER WE HAD IF NO PARTY HAD AN OVERALL MAJORITY. WE WOULD INSIST
THAT THE VIEWS OF THE SUBSTANTIAL SECTION OF THE ELECTORATE WHO HAD VOTED
FOR US WENT INTO THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE PROGRAMME OF A NEW GOVERNMENT WAS
DECIDED. IF OTHER PARTIES SEEK TO CHEAT THE ELECTORATE OF THAT RIGHT, WE
SHALL SEEK TO BRING THE MATTER BACK BEFORE THE VOTERS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO SEE THE VIEWS OF SO MANY VOTERS IGNORED ANY LONGER.

ALONGSIDE THIS PROGRAMME FOR GOVERNMENT THE ALLIANCE IS PUBLISHING
MANIFESTOS FOR SCOTLAND AND WALES, SETTING OUT OUR POLICIES ON THOSE ISSUES
WHICH WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE DEALT WITH BY DEVOLVED POWER.

AN ELECTION OF OPPORTUNITY

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE RIGHT, THAT OUR PROPOSALS ARE PRACTICAL
AND THAT OUR VALUES ARE THOSE WHICH ARE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED IN THE
GOVERNMENT OF THIS COUNTRY. WE MAKE NO CLAIM TO HAVE A MONOPOLY ON GOOD
IDEAS. WE SEEK FROM THE VOTERS THE CHANCE TO GIVE BACK TO THEM THE POWER AND
THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH ARE RIGHTLY THEIRS. THEIR TIME HAS COME.
