This week we contrast 'text as data' with other possible approaches to
studying text and language. We will see that the distinctive feature
of a text as a data approach (henceforward TADA) is its emphasis on
language as behaviour in an institutional setting. TADA de-emphasises -
indeed mostly just ignores - dictionary definitions and grammatical niceties to
focus on what language is being used to do, e.g. emphasize an issue or
express a position. In marked contrast to  other approaches e.g. from
psychology or discourse analysis, there is more concern for measurement and
much less concern for 'theory' with the idea that TADA is for connecting
textual data to domain theories (usually institutional or behavioural).
A running theme in this course is that TADA is about extending traditional
social science measurement strategies to deal with language.
