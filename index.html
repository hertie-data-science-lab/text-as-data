<h2>Text as Data</h2>

<p>
In the study of politics, text of one kind or another is often essential to measuring important underlying concepts, e.g. policy sentiment, issue frames, or ideological positions. It also poses special challenges, notably to machines but also to researchers who simply cannot themselves read everything their research designs require and must therefore look to operationalise and extend their own understanding using quantitative tools. This course is about the kinds of statistical and computational tools that political scientists and policy analysts have found useful for treating text 'as data'.

<p>
As the title suggests, this course focuses not on close reading (although that will often be necessary) nor on linguistic and stylistic features (although an understanding of these always helps) but rather on quantitative ways to conceptualise the content of texts so that they can be connected to other, often non-text focused, theories, e.g. of international trade, industrial regulation, or regional conflict. The text as data approach, and therefore also the course, is distinctive for example in analysing words not for what they 'mean' but in what they are 'used to mean' by particular institutionally embedded actors whose behaviour needs to be explained.

The course is a mix of theoretical and practical work with regular exercises - usually a mix of conceptual questions and R programming. Statistical concepts more advanced than taught in Statistics 1 will be explained as they arise. The first part of the course gets you familiar with the data side of analyzing text as data. This will be slightly more intensive than other courses whose data sources often do not need so much prior cleaning and arranging to work with. The next part of the course works introduces a small group of statistical concepts in the form of summary statistics, including keyness, concordances, word embeddings, and simple dictionary-based content analysis. The third part of the course shows how these are combined into useful tools such as topic models, sentiment analysis, and text scaling models.
