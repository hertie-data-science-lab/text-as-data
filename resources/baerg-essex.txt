Meetings

Classes will meet for ten sessions. Approximately 2/3 of the time will be devoted to lectures, and the other 1/3 will consist of “lab” sessions where we will work through exercises in class.

Computer Software Computer-based exercises will feature prominently in the course, especially in the lab sessions. The use of all software tools will be explained in the sessions, including how to download and install them. We will be working primarily in R, using the “quanteda” package.

Recommended Texts There is no really good single textbook that exists to cover computerized or quantitative text analysis.

Detailed Course Schedule Day 1: Quantitative text analysis overview and fundamentals This topic will introduce the goals and logistics of the course, provide an overview of the topics to be covered, and preview the software to be used. It will also introduce traditional (non-computer assisted) content analysis and distinguish this from computer-assisted methods and quantitative text analysis. We will cover the conceptual foundations of content analysis and quantitative content analysis, discuss the objectives, the approach to knowledge, and the particular view of texts when performing quantitative analysis. We will also work through some published examples.

Required Reading: Krippendorff (2013, Ch. 1,2,4) Wallach (2014)

Recommended Reading: Grimmer and Stewart (2013) Roberts (2000)

Lab session: Exercise 1: Working with Texts in quanteda

Day 2: Textual Data, Units of Analysis, Definitions of Documents and Features Textual data comes in many forms. Here we discuss those formats, and talk about text processing preparation of texts. These issues include where to obtain textual data; formatting and working with text files; indexing and meta-data; units of analysis; and definitions of features and measures commonly extracted from texts, including stemming, stop-words, and feature weighting.

Lab session: Exercise 2: Extracting features from texts

Day 3: Descriptive statistical methods for textual analysis Here we focus on quantitative methods for describing texts, focusing on summary measures that highlight particular characteristics of documents and allowing these to be compared. These methods include characterizing texts through concordances, co-occurrences, and keywords in context; complexity and readability measures; and an in-depth discussion of text types, tokens, and equivalencies.

Required Reading: Spirling (2016)

Recommended Reading: DuBay (2004) Krippendorff (2013, Ch. 10)

Lab session: Exercise 3: Descriptive summaries of texts

Day 4: Quantitative methods for comparing texts Quantitative methods for comparing texts, through concordances and keyword identification, dissimilarity measures, association models, and vector-space models.

Required Reading: Lowe et al. (2011) Manning, Raghavan and Schütze (2008, Section 6.3)

Recommended Reading: Krippendorff (2013, Ch. 11)

Lab session: Exercise 4: Document similarity and resampling texts

Day 5: Automated dictionary methods Automatic dictionary-based methods involve association of pre-defined word lists with particular quantitative values assigned by the researcher for some characteristic of interest. This topic covers the design model behind dictionary construction, including guidelines for testing and refining dictionaries. We will also review a variety of text pre-processing issues and textual data concepts such as word types, tokens, and equivalencies, including word stemming and trimming of words based on term and/or document frequency.

Required Reading: Laver and Garry (2000) Rooduijn and Pauwels (2011) Loughran and McDonald (2011)

Recommended Reading: Pennebaker and Chung (2008)

Assignment: Exercise 5: Applying dictionary coding

Day 6: Document classifiers and Supervised Learning Supervised classification methods permit the automatic classification of texts in a test set following machine learning from a training set. We will introduce machine learning methods for classifying documents, including one of the most popular classifiers, the Naive Bayes model, as well as k-nearest neighbour and support vector machines (SVMs). The topic also introduces validation and reporting methods for classifiers and discusses where these methods are applicable as well as pitfalls and problems which each method.

Assignment: Exercise 6: Examining movie reviews and political speeches by author. http://www.cs.cornell. edu/People/pabo/movie-review-data/ and the 10th Republican Presidential candidate debate using R and the quanteda package.

Day 7: Document classifiers and Unsupervised Learning Unlike in supervised learning methods, in unsupervised learning, we only have input data and no corresponding labeled output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is therefore to model the underlying structure of the data. Algorithms such as clustering and hierarchical clustering are used to try to discover and present the interesting structure in the data.

Recommended Reading: Quinn et al. (2010)

Assignment: Exercise 7: Examining UK political parties and Immigration speeches using R and the quanteda package.

Day 8: Scaling Texts This topic introduces methods for placing documents on continuous dimensions or “scales”, introducing the major non-parametric methods for scaling documents and discusses the situations where scaling methods are appropriate. Building on the Naive Bayes classifier, we introduce the “Wordscores” method of Laver, Benoit and Garry (2003) and show the link between classification and scaling. We also discusses the similarities and differences to other non-parametric scaling models such as correspondence analysis. We then look at scaling texts based on parametric approaches modelling features as Bernoulli or Poisson distributed, and contrasts these methods to other alternatives, critically examining the assumptions such models rely upon.

We also look at recent work that tries to combine both scaling and topic modeling together in a “semi-supervised” approach.
