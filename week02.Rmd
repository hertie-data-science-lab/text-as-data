This week we consider text in the same way we might think of economic
and social data. Naturally this will pose some challenges, notably
high dimensionality and very skewed frequency distributions at almost
all levels of unit, from paragraphs to documents. These pose some
unique measurement challenges, but have fairly intuitive, if sometimes
technically troublesome solutions.

It is traditional in all kinds of statistical studies  to distinguish
data 'pre-processing' from data 'modeling' or 'analysis'. TADA also
does so, but we will emphasize that all pre-processing is a form of
measurement modeling that brings efficiencies but also potential hazards.
Text pre-processing will be a major practical component
to most TADA analyses, so we should know what we are doing.
