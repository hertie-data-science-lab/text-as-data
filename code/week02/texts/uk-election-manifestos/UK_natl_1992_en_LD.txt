1992
CHANGING BRITAIN FOR GOOD

AFTER THE HEADLINE  "BE WARNED :THIS MANIFESTO MAY NOT BE WHAT 
YOU EXPECT" .THE INTRODUCTION OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC 
MANIFESTO DECLARED: 
    THIS MANIFESTO DOES NOT PROMISE GOOD TIMES JUST AROUND THE 
CORNER. IT DOES NOT AVOID DIFFICULT QUESTIONS OUT OF FEAR OF 
UNPOPULARITY. IT SIMPLY TELLS THE TRUTH; THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS BELIEVE HAS TO BE DONE IN ORDER FOR BRITAIN TO 
SUCCEED. 
    IF YOU WANT BRITAIN TO STAY THE SAME THEN YOU PROBABLY WON'T 
LIKE THIS MANIFESTO. BUT IF YOU WANT REAL CHANGE, IF YOU LONG FOR 
A BETTER FUTURE FOR YOURSELF, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COMMUNITY AND 
YOUR COUNTRY, THEN READ ON. 
    BUT BRITAIN WILL ONLY SUCCEED WHEN ITS POLITICAL LEADERS START 
TREATING VOTERS AS INFORMED CITIZENS WITH SHARED CONCERNS, NOT AS 
IGNORANT CONSUMERS TO BE MANIPULATED. NOW IS THE TIME FOR 
CHANGE. SO THIS MANIFESTO IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS YOU MAY READ. 
    WE DO NOT SHRINK FROM THE REAL CHOICES FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE 
ARE NOT AFRAID TO SAY WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID. WE ARE NOT AFRAID TO 
DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND WE ARE CLEAR THAT IF WE WANT TO 
MAKE A MODERN BRITAIN, WE MUST FIRST CHANGE BRITAIN.
 
WHAT LIBERAL DEMOCRATS STAND FOR

THE MANIFESTO BEGAN: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS PUT PEOPLE FIRST. WE 
AIM TO CREATE A SOCIETY IN WHICH ALL MEN AND WOMEN CAN REALISE 
THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND SHAPE THEIR OWN SUCCESSES. WE BELIEVE 
THAT IF WE COULD LIBERATE THIS WEALTH OF TALENT WE WOULD TRANSFORM 
OUR ECONOMY AND CREATE A SHARED SOCIETY OF WHICH WE SHOULD ALL 
BE PROUD. 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS KNOW THAT THIS CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT 
FUNDAMENTAL REFORM. 
    WE MUST CHANGE OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM TO GIVE THE CITIZEN MORE 
POWER AND THE GOVERNMENT LESS; OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM TO CONFER 
POWER ON CONSUMERS AND TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH A SHARE IN 
THE WEALTH THEY CREATE; OUR PUBLIC SERVICES TO GUARANTEE CHOICE 
AND DIGNITY TO EACH OF US; AND OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM TO EQUIP US 
BETTER FOR THE MODERN WORLD. 
    LIBERAL DEMOCRATS RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE THINGS WE 
OWN IN PRIVATE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THE VALUE OF WHAT WE HOLD IN 
COMMON. WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE AT THEIR BEST AS MEMBERS OF 
COMMUNITIES, WHERE THEY CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER AND FOR THOSE 
LESS FORTUNATE THAN THEMSELVES. SO OUR POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO 
STRENGTHEN COMMUNITIES, TACKLE CRIME AND POVERTY, BUILD UP THE 
COMMON WEALTH AND IMPROVE THE SHARED QUALITY OF LIFE. 
    IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE WE KNOW THAT THE FREE MARKET IS THE 
BEST GUARANTEE OF RESPONSIVENESS TO CHOICE AND CHANGE. BUT WE 
BELIEVE THE MARKET SHOULD BE OUR SERVANT NOT OUR MASTER. SO WE 
SEE THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT AS CRUCIAL IN MAKING THE MARKET WORK 
PROPERLY, BY CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESS, PROMOTING 
COMPETITION, BREAKING UP MONOPOLIES AND SPREADING 
INFORMATION. AND GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE READY TO MAKE THE 
INVESTMENTS WHICH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WILL NOT, WHETHER IN 
TRANSPORT, EDUCATION OR PUBLIC WORKS. 
    LIBERAL DEMOCRATS KNOW THAT WE HAVE A DUTY, NOT ONLY TO EACH 
OTHER BUT TO THE GENERATIONS WHICH FOLLOW US, TO PROTECT THE 
ENVIRONMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS BEST ACHIEVED NOT BY MAKING 
PEOPLE POORER OR LESS FREE BUT BY BUILDING TRUE ENVIRONMENTAL 
COSTS INTO THE MARKET SO AS TO REWARD THOSE WHO CONSERVE AND 
PENALISE THOSE WHO POLLUTE. 
    LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE UNCOMPROMISINGLY INTERNATIONALIST. WE 
KNOW THAT THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT BRITAIN CAN ACHIEVE ALONE AND 
WE ARE COMMITTED TO BUILDING IN THE WIDER WORLD THE SORT OF 
SOCIETY WE STRIVE FOR AT HOME, FOUNDED ON MUTUAL COOPERATION, 
POLITICAL LIBERTY AND SHARED PROSPERITY. WE HAVE LONG BEEN 
COMMITTED EUROPEANS, BELIEVING THAT BRITAIN CAN ONLY BE SECURE. 
SUCCESSFUL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE IF WE PLAY OUR FULL PART IN 
BUILDING A MORE UNITED AND DEMOCRATIC EUROPE. 
    GLOBALLY, LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL WORK TO STRENGTHEN 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. WE REJECT OUTDATED NOTIONS OF NATIONAL 
SOVEREIGNTY, BELIEVING THAT THEY NOW STAND IN THE WAY OF 
COMMON ACTION TO DEAL WITH THE SCOURGES OF DISEASE AND HUNGER, 
THE DETERIORATION OF THE EARTH'S ENVIRONMENT AND THE CONTINUING 
ANGERS OF THE POST-COLD WAR WORLD. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL 
GOVERNMENT, WHETHER LOCAL, NATIONAL, OR INCREASINGLY EUROPEAN, 
SHOULD BE BOUND BY THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND SHOULD BE 
FULLY ACCOUNTABLE.  
   BECAUSE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ALONE UNDERSTAND THAT WE SHALL NOT 
CHANGE BRITAIN'S FUTURE UNLESS AND UNTIL WE CHANGE BRITAIN'S 
ELECTORAL SYSTEM, WE ARE COMMITTED TO ELECTORAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL 
REFORM. WE SHALL NOT REST UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT OF BRITAIN FULLY 
BELONGS TO THE CITIZENS IT IS THERE TO SERVE.
 
BRITAIN'S BALANCE SHEET

IN DRAWING UP THIS MANIFESTO, WE HAVE BEGUN FROM WHERE 
BRITAIN IS TODAY. LIKE ANY GOOD AUDITOR, WE HAVE BEEN REALISTIC 
ABOUT NATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AND FAILURES, ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES AND 
PROBLEMS. THE RESULT IS A BALANCE SHEET WHICH SHOWS OUR 
COUNTRY'S STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.DESPITE SOME POINTS OF 
PROMISE AND POTENTIAL, BRITAIN'S BALANCE SHEET SHOWS HOW MUCH 
STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE FOLLOWING PAGES REVEAL THE EXTENT TO 
WHICH, IN THE ECONOMY, IN THE ENVIRONMENT, IN EDUCATION, AND IN 
LOCAL SERVICES, SUCCESSIVE BRITISH GOVERNMENTS HAVE FAILED TO 
REALISE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PAST DECADES. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 
BRIGHT SPOTS, THE GENERAL PICTURE IS ONE OF RELATIVE DECLINE IN 
RELATION TO OTHER ADVANCED DEMOCRACIES. FORTY YEARS OF FAILURE ARE 
THE RESULT NOT ONLY OF MISJUDGED POLICIES FROM BOTH CONSERVATIVE 
AND LABOUR GOVERNMENTS .EVEN MORE CRUCIALLY, THEY ARE THE 
PRODUCT OF AN OUTDATED POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH HAS CONSISTENTLY 
SACRIFICED THE LONG TERM TO THE SHORT TERM AND ABANDONED 
PRINCIPLES FOR EXPEDIENCY. 
THE ECONOMIC BALANCE SHEET

UK EXPORTS IN 1991: ~103,804M. BUT IMPORTS HAVE GROWN EVEN 
MORE, TO ~113,770M. THE BALANCE OF TRADE HAS BEEN NEGATIVE 
SINCE 1982, AND IN 1989 HIT A RECORD ~24 BILLION. INDUSTRIAL 
RELATIONS: ALTHOUGH INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, AS MEASURED BY STRIKES, 
HAVE IMPROVED, THERE HAS STILL BEEN RELATIVELY LITTLE PROGRESS 
TOWARDS INVOLVING EMPLOYEES IN THE SUCCESS OF THEIR 
ENTERPRISES-THROUGH PROFIT-SHARING, SHARE OWNERSHIP AND 
STRUCTURES OF PARTICIPATION. POSITIVES: I IN SOME WAYS BRITISH 
INDUSTRY IS THRIVING. IN 1991 EXPORTS CLIMBED TO A RECORD LEVEL OF 
~103,804 MILLION. 2 INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS HAVE IMPROVED MARKEDLY 
SINCE THE 1970S. TRADE UNIONS HAVE BECOME MORE RESPONSIBLE 
AND DEMOCRATIC. DAYS LOST THROUGH STRIKES FELL FROM MORE THAN 29 
MILLION IN 1979 TO UNDER A MILLION IN THE YEAR TO OCTOBER 1991. 3 
THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH INCOME-TAX RATES INHERITED FROM THE LAST 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT DOWN-FROM A TOP RATE 
OF 83 PER CENT IN 1979 TO 40 PER CENT IN 1992. NEGATIVES: I 
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN THE MOST OBVIOUS COST OF THE CURRENT 
RECESSION. THE LATEST FIGURES SHOW 2,604,100 OUT OF WORK. THE 
NUMBER UNEMPLOYED FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS HAS DOUBLED IN 
THE PAST YEAR. 2 THE RECESSION IS BITING DEEPLY INTO INDUSTRY. 
BUSINESS BANKRUPTCIES HAVE JUMPED FROM 28,935 TO 47,777 IN 
1991. 3 HIGH INTEREST RATES ARE THROTTLING THE CHANCES OF 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. BRITISH THREE-MONTH RATES STOOD AT 10.7 PER 
CENT IN FEBRUARY, COMPARED TO 9.5 PER CENT IN GERMANY, 5.3 PER 
CENT IN JAPAN AND 4.3 PER CENT IN THE US. SHORT-TERM 
MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY HAS MEANT THAT GOVERNMENTS 
MANIPULATE INTEREST RATES TO ENSURE RE-ELECTION, RATHER THAN WITH 
THE LONG TERM INTERESTS OF THE ECONOMY IN MIND. INTEREST RATES FELL 
BEFORE EACH OF THE LAST TWO GENERAL ELECTIONS, ONLY TO RISE AGAIN 
AFTERWARDS. 4 BRITAIN IS FAILING TO INVEST FOR THE LONG TERM. 
INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY FELL FROM ~3- 1 BILLION IN 
THE FIRST QUARTER OF 1990 TO ~2.5 BILLION IN THE LAST QUARTER OF 
1991. THIS DECLINE IS NOT JUST A FEATURE OF THE CURRENT RECESSION. 
FROM 1979 TO 1983 THE ANNUAL LEVEL OF MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT 
FELL BY 33 PER CENT. IT RECOVERED TO ITS 1979 LEVEL ONLY IN 1988. 5 
THIS FAILURE TO INVEST FOR THE LONG TERM CAN BE SEEN ALSO IN 
INNOVATION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW IDEAS AND PRODUCTS. IN 
1984-8 ONLY 3.4 PER CENT OF PATENTS GRANTED IN THE US TO OTHER 
NATIONALS WENT TO BRITONS (3.7 PER CENT IN 1979-83). BY 
COMPARISON, FRANCE HAD GROWN FROM 3.3 PER CENT TO 3.4 PER CENT 
AND JAPAN MANAGED 18.8 PER CENT (AGAINST 12.9 PER CENT IN THE 
EARLIER PERIOD). 6 BRITAIN'S RECORD OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IS VERY 
POOR. THE UK ECONOMY CONTRACTED BY 2.2 PER CENT IN 1991-THE 
BIGGEST ANNUAL FALL SINCE THE 1930S WHILE ITALY'S GREW BY I .3 PER 
CENT AND GERMANY'S BY I .9 PER CENT. 7 CONSERVATIVE 
MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY HAS STOKED THE BIGGEST CREDIT BOOM 
IN BRITAIN'S HISTORY. AVERAGE PERSONAL DEBT AS A PROPORTION OF 
DISPOSABLE HOUSEHOLD INCOME MUSHROOMED FROM 57 PER CENT IN 
1980 TO 114 PER CENT IN 1990. 8 CONSERVATIVE TAXATION POLICIES 
MAY HAVE REDUCED HIGH MARGINAL INCOME-TAX RATES, BUT IT WAS THE 
RICH WHO BENEFITED, NOT THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. FROM THE 
BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE 1980S, TAKE HOME PAY ROSE BY 41.4 
PER CENT FOR THOSE ON N2 TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, BY 37 PER 
CENT FOR THOSE ON THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND BY ONLY 32 PER CENT FOR 
THOSE ON HALF THE AVERAGE. 

THE ENVIRONMENTAL BALANCE SHEET

RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION: 45 PER CENT OF ELECTRICITY DEMAND 
COULD BE MET FROM WIND POWER. IN FACT THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY 
PRODUCED BY RENEWABLE SOURCES IN THE UK HAS STEADILY DECLINED 
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. WHILE FRANCE PRODUCES ALMOST 20 PER 
CENT OF ITS ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES THE UK MANAGES ONLY 
I .3 PER CENT. UNLEADED PETROL: AS IN SO MANY ENVIRONMENTAL 
MATTERS, BRITAIN WAS LATE IN INTRODUCING TAX DIFFERENTIALS FOR 
UNLEADED FUEL. IN 1989. SALES OF UNLEADED FUEL IN GERMANY WERE 
MORE THAN DOUBLE THOSE IN THE UK. POSITIVES: I BRITAIN HAS A 
MASSIVE ADVANTAGE IN NATURAL RESOURCES THAT GIVE IT THE POTENTIAL 
TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION. 
GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES SHOW THAT UP TO 45 PER CENT OF ELECTRICITY 
DEMAND COULD BE MET FROM WIND POWER. 2 GOVERNMENT ACTION 
CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS STANDARDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. 
THE MARKET SHARE OF UNLEADED PETROL ROSE FROM 1.1 PER CENT TO 
43.0 PER CENT BETWEEN AUGUST 1988 AND NOVEMBER 1991. DUE TO 
WIDENING TAX DIFFERENTIALS.
3 BRITAIN HAS A POSITIVE RECORD ON PROTECTING ITS COUNTRYSIDE. 
MORE OF OUR LAND IS PROTECTED IN NATIONAL PARKS THAN ANY OTHER EC 
MEMBER, AND ONE MORE HAS RECENTLY BEEN ANNOUNCED, IN THE NEW 
FOREST. NEGATIVES: I IN TOO MANY WAYS BRITAIN UNFORTUNATELY 
DESERVES ITS NICKNAME OF THE DIRTY MAN OF EUROPE. CARBON 
DIOXIDE EMISSIONS-THE MAIN SOURCE OF GLOBAL WARMING-
INCREASED IN THE UK FROM 525 MILLION TONNES IN 1986 TO 530 
MILLION IN 1989. THE UN ESTIMATES THAT A REDUCTION IN CARBON 
DIOXIDE EMISSION OF 20 PER CENT BY 2005 WILL BE NECESSARY TO 
AVOID POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING. YET THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS COMMITTED BRITAIN MERELY TO STABILISE EMISSION 
BY 2005-WELL BEHIND THE MAJORITY OF EC COUNTRIES. 2 THE UK 
PRODUCES MORE SULPHUR DIOXIDE, THE MAIN CAUSE OF ACID RAIN, THAN 
ANY OTHER EC MEMBER, BUT IS ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO INSTALL 
POLLUTION-CONTROL DEVICES TO POWER STATIONS. GERMANY STARTED IN 
1984. 3 PROSECUTIONS FOR WATER POLLUTION MORE THAN DOUBLED 
BETWEEN 1981 AND 1988, WHILE AN ADDITIONAL 40 BEACHES WERE 
FOUND NOT BE COMPLYING WITH EC STANDARDS IN 1990-MAKING A 
TOTAL OF 20 PER CENT OF ALL BRITISH BEACHES. 4 THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
FAILED TO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY 
SOURCES-DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY AVOID THE POLLUTION PROBLEMS 
ASSOCIATED WITH COAL, OIL AND GAS. CURRENTLY, JUST OVER £20 
MILLION IS SPENT ANNUALLY ON RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT, COMPARED TO MORE THAN £200 MILLION A YEAR ON 
NUCLEAR POWER. 5 EVEN WORSE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS CUT THE 
BUDGET OF THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF OFFICE, WHILE INVESTMENT IN 
ENERGY CONSERVATION WOULD SAVE MONEY AND REDUCE POLLUTION. 
THE 1990-1 LEVEL OF FUNDING, A MEAGRE £23 MILLION, IS LOWER 
THAN IT WAS FOUR YEARS BEFORE. 6 POLLUTION FROM ROAD TRANSPORT 
HAS RISEN FROM 884 MILLION TONNES OF NITROGEN OXIDES IN 1980 TO 
1,298 MILLION TONNES IN 1989. CONGESTION ON THE ROADS COSTS AN 
ESTIMATED £ 15 BILLION A YEAR, YET THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO 
DO NOTHING TO CURB THE RATE OF GROWTH OF CAR USE-ESTIMATED AT 
142 PER CENT BETWEEN 1990 AND 2005. 7 AT THE SAME TIME, THE 
PROPORTION OF FREIGHT CARRIED ON THE RAILWAYS BETWEEN 1989 AND 
1990 DROPPED FROM 9 PER CENT TO 7 PER CENT, WHILE THE PROPORTION 
USING ROAD TRANSPORT ROSE TO 83 PER CENT. 8 RAIL TRANSPORT IS 
PLACED AT A DISADVANTAGE IN BRITAIN. LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT 
SUPPORT FOR THE RAILWAYS FELL THROUGHOUT THE 1980S, FROM £1,262 
MILLION IN 1980-1 TO £462 MILLION IN 1990-1. 

THE EDUCATIONAL BALANCE SHEET

NUMBER OF TEACHERS: THE RETENTION RATE OF TEACHERS IS VERY BAD. 
MORE THAN HALF OF THE COUNTRY'S QUALIFIED TEACHERS HAVE LEFT THE 
PROFESSION. PUPIL-TEACHER RATIOS:IN RECENT YEARS, THE PUPIL-TEACHER 
RATIO HAS TURNED UP ONCE AGAIN-FROM 16.9 IN 1990 TO 17.2 IN 
1991. POSITIVES: I IN SOME WAYS EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS ARE 
IMPROVING. THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS IN NURSERY AND PRIMARY 
EDUCATION GREW FROM 176,228 IN 1986 TO 193,516 IN 1991. 2 
SIMILARLY, PUPIL-TEACHER RATIOS FELL FROM 18.2 IN 1980-1 TO 16.9 
IN 1990-1.
3 SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CHANGES HAVE BEEN FOR THE BETTER. 
THE IDEA OF LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF SCHOOLS HAS, IN SOME PLACES, 
PRODUCED SCHOOL MANAGEMENT OF IMAGINATION AND QUALITY. 
NEGATIVES: I OVERALL, GOVERNMENT FUNDING OF EDUCATION IS 
INADEQUATE. THE PROPORTION OF BRITAIN'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT 
DEVOTED TO EDUCATION FELL FROM 5.6 PER CENT IN 1981-2 TO 5 PER 
CENT IN 1990 I.IN THE SAME YEAR FRANCE INVESTED 5.7 PER CENT OF 
GDP,THE US 6.7 PER CENT AND IRELAND 7.1 PER CENT. THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN QUITE HAPPY TO INVEST WHEN IT SUITS ITS OWN 
IDEOLOGICAL ENDS. PUPILS IN OPTED-OUT SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED AT AN 
AVERAGE OF FOUR TIMES THE LEVEL OF LEA PUPILS. 2 THE NUMBER OF 
SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS FELL FROM 224,618 IN 1986 TO 198,030 
IN 1991.
3 THERE HAS BEEN A SERIOUS DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
QUALIFYING AS TEACHERS, DOWN FROM 25,000 IN 1980 TO 18,500 IN 
1988. THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING FURTHER CUTS IN TEACHER-
TRAINING FACILITIES. 4 BRITISH CHILDREN LOSE OUT IN CRITICAL AREAS OF 
EDUCATION. THE PROPORTION OF CHILDREN IN PRE COMPULSORY 
EDUCATION IN 1987-8 WAS A MERE 3.6 PER CENT, COMPARED TO 13.5 
PER CENT IN GERMANY, 17 PER CENT IN BELGIUM AND 18.4 PER CENT 
IN FRANCE. 5 COMPARED TO OUR COMPETITORS, NOT ENOUGH OF OUR 
YOUNG PEOPLE STAY ON TO POST-COMPULSORY EDUCATION. THE 
PROPORTION OF 16- 18 YEAR OLDS IN FULL-TIME EDUCATION OR TRAINING 
WAS 35 PER CENT IN BRITAIN IN 1988, COMPARED TO 47 PER CENT IN 
GERMANY, 66 PER CENT IN FRANCE AND 79 PER CENT IN THE US. 6 
INVESTMENT IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS FALLEN 
FROM 0.35 PER CENT TO 0.28% OF GDP (WHILE IN GERMANY IT 
STANDS AT 0.40%), NOT ONLY AFFECTING OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM 
BUT CREATING A KNOCK-ON EFFECT THROUGHOUT THE BRITISH ECONOMY. 

THE SOCIAL BALANCE SHEET

HOME OWNERSHIP: GOVERNMENT HELP HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO HOME 
OWNERS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS. INVESTMENT IN LOCAL AUTHORITY 
HOUSING HAS COLLAPSED AND NO HELP IS AVAILABLE TO THE PRIVATE 
RENTED SECTOR.
POLICE INSUFFICIENT EFFORT HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO MAKING SURE 
POLICEMEN ARE ON THE BEAT. A MORE VISIBLE POLICE PRESENCE IN 
COMMUNITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO COMBAT BOTH CRIME AND THE FEAR OF 
CRIME.
POSITIVES: I OVERALL, BRITISH STANDARDS OF HEALTH ARE IMPROVING. 
LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR MEN ROSE FROM 70.8 YEARS IN 1981 TO 73.2 
YEARS IN 1991, AND FOR WOMEN FROM 76.8 TO 78.8 YEARS. 2 HOME 
OWNERSHIP IN BRITAIN ROSE FROM 55.8 PER CENT OF HOUSEHOLDS IN 
1981 TO 67.3% IN 1991.
3 THE SIZE OF THE POLICE ESTABLISHMENT HAS INCREASED BY 15 PER 
CENT SINCE 1978-9. EXPENDITURE ON THE POLICE ROSE BY 55 PER CENT 
IN REAL TERMS OVER THE SAME PERIOD, AND POLICE PAY SHOWED A 29 
PER CENT REAL RISE. NEGATIVES: I WHILE THE NHS HOSPITAL SECTOR'S 
REAL PURCHASING POWER GREW BY 15.6 PER CENT BETWEEN 1980-1 
AND 1990-1, EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS (DUE TO DEMOGRAPHIC 
CHANGE AND THE RISING COSTS OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY) IN FACT 
INCREASED BY 21.3 PER CENT. THE CUMULATIVE SHORTFALL IN THE 
HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES SECTOR IN ENGLAND ALONE 
NOW STANDS AT £4.44 BILLION. 2 THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
WAITING FOR NHS TREATMENT IN THE UK ROSE TO MORE THAN ONE 
MILLION IN MARCH 1990. TWENTY-FIVE PER CENT OF INPATIENTS WAIT 
FOR LONGER THAN A YEAR FOR TREATMENT. 3 THE NUMBER OF SIGHT TESTS 
HAS FALLEN BY 21 PER CENT SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF CHARGES IN 
1988.
4 THE GOVERNMENT HAS WITHDRAWN FUNDING FOR NEW HOUSE 
BUILDING, AND REFUSED TO ALLOW COUNCILS TO SPEND THE RECEIPTS THEY 
HAVE GAINED FROM NEW HOME OWNERS. AS A RESULT, THE AMOUNT OF 
LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSING BUILT HAS FALLEN FROM MORE THAN 65,300 
HOMES IN 1979 TO A MERE 8,600 IN 1990. 5 THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
ACCEPTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES AS HOMELESS ROSE FROM 70,000 IN 
1979 TO ALMOST 170,000 IN 1990-AND THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE 
SINGLE HOMELESS. 6 WITH THE MASSIVE EXPANSION OF MORTGAGE 
LENDING AND THE SUBSEQUENT USE OF INTEREST RATES TO BRING DOWN 
INFLATION, THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGES OVER 12 MONTHS IN ARREARS 
ROSE FROM 59,690 IN JUNE 1991 TO 91,740 BY THE END OF THE YEAR. 
THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES REPOSSESSED ROSE BY 74 PER CENT OVER 
THE 1990 FIGURE TO 75,540 IN 1991. 7 OUTCOMES HAVE FAILED 
DISASTROUSLY TO MATCH THE INPUT OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO LAW AND 
ORDER. RECORDED RATES OF NOTIFIED CRIME HAVE INCREASED YEAR ON 
YEAR BY 5.5 PER CENT ON AVERAGE, AND BY A MASSIVE 16 PER CENT IN 
1990-91. 8 AT THE SAME TIME, CRIME CLEAR-UP RATES HAVE DECLINED 
TO 32 PER CENT.
9 BRITAIN HAS PROPORTIONATELY THE LARGEST PRISON POPULATION OF ANY 
EC COUNTRY-AND WE ALSO HAVE MORE PRISONERS SERVING LIFE 
SENTENCES THAN THE REST OF THE EC COMBINED. NOT ONLY IS 
IMPRISONMENT OF DOUBTFUL VALUE FOR MANY OFFENDERS, IT IS ALSO 
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY WOULD RESULT FROM 
LESS USE OF CUSTODY FOR MANY CLASSES OF OFFENDER.
 
POLICIES FOR THE NEW CENTURY 

IT IS CLEAR FROM OUR ANALYSIS OF BRITAIN'S BALANCE SHEET THAT BRITAIN 
NEEDS CHANGE. HERE ARE OUR FIRST STEPS, THE KEY MEASURES WHICH 
WE BELIEVE MUST BE TAKEN STRAIGHT AWAY IF WE ARE TO BREAK THE 
CYCLE OF BRITAIN'S DECLINE, UNLOCK THE FULL SCOPE OF BRITAIN'S 
POTENTIAL AND PAVE THE WAY TO FUTURE SUCCESS. 
¥ BRITAIN'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS NEED THOROUGH-GOING REFORM: 
STABLE AND REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT, ELECTED PARLIAMENTS IN 
SCOTLAND AND WALES, DECENTRALISATION OF POWER TO THE ENGLISH 
REGIONS AND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT, FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND A 
BILL OF RIGHTS. AS THE ESSENTIAL MEASURE TO SECURE AND ENTRENCH 
LASTING REFORM WE WILL INTRODUCE FAIR VOTES BY PROPORTIONAL 
REPRESENTATION FOR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. 
¥ IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RECESSION, THE ECONOMY NEEDS NEW IMPETUS 
NOT A TAX CUT. WE WILL IMMEDIATELY INTRODUCE AN EMERGENCY 
PROGRAMME OF INVESTMENT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN PUBLIC 
WORKS IN ORDER TO GET COMPANIES AND PEOPLE BACK TO WORK, THUS 
REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT BY 600,000 OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. 
¥ LOWER INFLATION AND A STABLE CLIMATE FOR INDUSTRY TO PLAN AND 
PROSPER WILL LEAD TO LONG-TERM PROSPERITY. WE WILL GIVE THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND INDEPENDENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONETARY POLICY, WITH 
A REQUIREMENT TO PROMOTE PRICE STABILITY. WE WILL PUT THE POUND 
INTO THE NARROW BAND OF THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM. 
¥ ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES MUST BE BUILT INTO ALL ECONOMIC 
DECISION-MAKING, ENSURING THAT ECONOMIC SUCCESS GOES HAND IN 
HAND WITH ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY. WE WILL INTRODUCE NEW 
ENVIRONMENTAL INCENTIVES. 
¥ THE SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE MUST BE 
ADEQUATE TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEW CENTURY. WE WILL 
INCREASE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION BY £2 BILLION, FUNDING THIS BY 
AN INCREASE OF I P ON INCOME TAX. 
¥ OLDER PEOPLE DESERVE GREATER SECURITY. WE WILL PROTECT PRIVATE 
PENSIONS, AND INCREASE THE BASIC STATE PENSION, MAKING IT PAYABLE 
AS OF RIGHT WITHOUT MEANS TESTING. 
¥ BRITAIN'S FUTURE MUST BE SAFEGUARDED BY ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP OF A 
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY WHICH IS UNITED AND DEMOCRATIC AND IN 
WHICH DECISIONS ARE TAKEN AS CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. WE 
WILL TAKE DECISIVE STEPS TOWARDS THE ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND 
POLITICAL UNION OF A DEMOCRATIC EUROPE. ONLY WHEN THESE KEY 
STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN WILL GOVERNMENT AND INDIVIDUALS ALIKE BE 
ABLE TO PLAN FOR THE LONG TERM, INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE SHORT 
TERM AND THE NEXT ELECTION. THE BALANCE OF THIS MANIFESTO SETS OUT 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT VISION OF THE FUTURE: OUR LONG-TERM 
PROGRAMME FOR GOVERNMENT .THE DETAILED COSTING AND REVENUE 
RAISING EFFECTS OF OUR PROPOSALS ARE CONTAINED IN A SEPARATE 
SUPPLEMENT.


1. BRITAIN'S PROSPERITY: PUBLIC INVESTMENT; 
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS AIM TO ENCOURAGE A COMPETITIVE AND 
ENTERPRISING ECONOMY WHICH IS ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE, 
FOUNDED ON PARTNERSHIP AND ADVANCED SKILLS AND CLOSELY 
INTEGRATED WITH EUROPE.
     WHAT THE ECONOMY NEEDS IS A NEW IMPETUS. THE 
GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED TAX CUT WILL NOT ACHIEVE THIS. ONLY NEW 
INVESTMENT WILL PROVIDE THE KICK-START NEEDED TO ESCAPE FROM 
RECESSION AND REDUCE THE WASTE OF TALENT AND ENERGY WHICH 
RESULTS FROM UNEMPLOYMENT. 
    BUT LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ALSO RECOGNISE BRITAIN'S LONG-TERM 
NEEDS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE FREE MARKET, TO FREE TRADE AND TO 
THE CREATION OF A COMPETITIVE AND ENTERPRISING ECONOMY. WE DO 
NOT BELIEVE IT IS GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO RUN BUSINESS-PEOPLE DO 
THAT MUCH BETTER. WE SEE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE AS ENABLING FIRMS 
AND ENTREPRENEURS TO HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE CHANCE. THAT MEANS 
ENCOURAGING COMPETITION, INVESTING IN SKILLS, INVOLVING 
EMPLOYEES IN THE SUCCESS OF THEIR COMPANIES, NURTURING SMALL 
BUSINESSES, PLAYING A POSITIVE PART IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW 
EUROPEAN ECONOMY AND, ABOVE ALL, BRINGING GREATER STABILITY TO 
NATIONAL ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. 
    OUR LONG-TERM AIM IS TO SHIFT THE BURDEN OF TAXATION AWAY FROM 
THE THINGS THE COUNTRY NEEDS MORE OF-INCOME, SAVINGS AND 
VALUE ADDED-AND ON TO THE THINGS WE WANT LESS OF, SUCH AS 
POLLUTION AND RESOURCE DEPLETION. 
 
TURNING BRITAIN ROUND

THE CURRENT RECESSION IS UNDERMINING BRITAIN'S COMPETITIVENESS 
AND FUTURE SUCCESS. UNEMPLOYMENT AND BUSINESS CLOSURES LEAD 
TO A WASTAGE OF TALENT AND A LOSS OF RESOURCES. AT THE SAME TIME, 
ESSENTIAL INVESTMENT IN OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE, IN INFRASTRUCTURE, IN 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND IN INNOVATION IS BEING NEGLECTED. 
    LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL INTRODUCE AN EMERGENCY PROGRAMME OF 
INVESTMENT TO END THE SLUMP. WE WILL IMMEDIATELY PUT IN HAND A 
MAJOR PROGRAMME OF PUBLIC CAPITAL INVESTMENT, FUNDED BY 
REVERSING THE TORY TAX CUT TOGETHER WITH A PRUDENT INCREASE IN 
BORROWING.  
   THIS, COMBINED WITH A FREEZE IN BUSINESS RATES AND NEW 
INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION TO INCREASE THE NATION'S SKILLS, WILL KICK-
START RECOVERY AND CREATE JOBS. WE WILL:
 ¥ ATTACK UNEMPLOYMENT BY CREATING NEW EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES. OUR EMERGENCY PROGRAMME SHOULD REDUCE 
UNEMPLOYMENT BY AT LEAST 600,000 OVER TWO YEARS. WE WILL 
INCREASE SPENDING ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT, HOUSING, HOSPITALS AND 
SCHOOLS, ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION PROJECTS AND ON 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING - ALL SENSIBLE INVESTMENTS FOR THE 
COUNTRY'S FUTURE. WE WILL AIM TO GUARANTEE EVERYONE OUT OF WORK 
FOR SIX MONTHS OR MORE A PLACE ON EITHER A HIGH QUALITY TRAINING 
PROGRAMME OR ON A WORK PROGRAMME WITH A STRONG ELEMENT OF 
TRAINING.
 ¥ INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR TRANSPORT 
INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING A DEDICATED HIGH-SPEED RAIL LINK FROM THE 
CHANNEL TUNNEL TO CONNECT WITH THE MAJOR ROUTES TO THE NORTH AND 
WEST OF BRITAIN, AND THE EXTENSION OF ELECTRIFICATION THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE EXPANSION OF AIRPORTS OUTSIDE 
THE SOUTH EAST.
 ¥ FREEZE BUSINESS RATES THIS YEAR, THUS EFFECTIVELY REDUCING THEM 
IN REAL TERMS, A LARGER REDUCTION THAN THAT PROMISED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT.
 ¥ CREATE A TRAINING INCENTIVE FOR FIRMS THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION 
OF A LEVY EQUAL TO 2 PER CENT OF PAYROLL, FROM WHICH THEY WOULD 
DEDUCT THEIR EXPENDITURE ON TRAINING. WE WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS 
TO RELEASE THEIR EMPLOYEES AGED UNDER 19 FOR A MINIMUM OF TWO 
DAYS A WEEK FURTHER EDUCATION AND/OR TRAINING FOR NATIONALLY 
RECOGNISED QUALIFICATIONS. WE WILL ESTABLISH A FULLY INTEGRATED 
SYSTEM OF SKILLS TRAINING, LEADING TO RECOGNISED QUALIFICATIONS FOR 
A BROAD RANGE OF SKILLS. WE WILL INCREASE ACCESS COURSES FOR 
MATURE STUDENTS AND RETRAINING FOR WOMEN RETURNERS AND THOSE IN 
MID-CAREER. WE WILL FUND CRASH COURSES IN THE MAIN AREAS OF SKILL 
SHORTAGE, AIMED IN PARTICULAR AT THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED.
 ¥ INVEST IN LOCAL ECONOMIES. WE WILL SET UP AND FUND NEW 
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LOCAL ENTERPRISE AGENCIES. WE WILL 
ENCOURAGE TECS TO BECOME STRONG, LOCALLY BASED, EMPLOYER-LED 
ORGANISATIONS PROVIDING BUSINESS SERVICES, ACTING AS AN EFFECTIVE 
VOICE FOR BUSINESS AT LOCAL LEVEL, AND OVERSEEING TRAINING OF THOSE 
IN EMPLOYMENT. WE WILL ENCOURAGE DECENTRALISATION OF BANKS AND 
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE WILL END THE PRESENT 
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY OF CLAWING BACK FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
AMOUNTS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE THEY RECEIVE FROM THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITY'S REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND.
 ¥ INVEST IN RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND DESIGN. WE WILL INCREASE 
IMMEDIATELY THE GOVERNMENT SCIENCE BUDGET TO 0.35 PER CENT OF 
GDP AND RAISE IT STEADILY THEREAFTER. WE WILL ESTABLISH REGIONAL 
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CENTRES TO BRING TOGETHER THE RESOURCES OF 
INDUSTRY, COLLEGES, AND GOVERNMENT LABS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE 
INDUSTRY TO INVEST IN INNOVATION AND TO IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF 
SEEDCORN CAPITAL. WE WILL REVERSE CUTS IN DESIGN CONSULTANCY 
SCHEMES AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE DESIGN COUNCIL. 

MAKING BRITAIN COMPETITIVE

A CLIMATE OF ENTERPRISE AND COMPETITION IS VITAL IF BRITISH INDUSTRY 
AND PRODUCTS ARE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OVERSEAS MARKETS. YET 
THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT HAS CONCENTRATED INSTEAD ON CONVERTING 
PUBLIC INTO PRIVATE MONOPOLIES. WE WILL: 
¥ STIMULATE COMPETITION. WE WILL TAKE TOUGH ACTION AGAINST 
MONOPOLIES, MERGERS AND FINANCIAL RAIDS. THE MONOPOLIES AND 
MERGERS COMMISSION WILL BE COMBINED WITH THE OF OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING AND MADE INDEPENDENT OF GOVERNMENT, INCREASING 
ITS EFFECTIVENESS. WE WILL INTRODUCE A RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES ACT TO 
PENALISE ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR AND END PRICE-FIXING BY 
CARTELS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE GREATER COMPETITION IN THE BANKING 
SECTOR.
 ¥ BREAK UP MONOPOLIES. WE WILL BREAK UP THE MONOPOLY 
PROVIDERS OF SERVICES SUCH AS BRITISH TELECOM AND BRITISH GAS. 
WE WILL PERMIT ACCESS BY PRIVATE OPERATORS TO THE BRITISH RAIL 
TRACK NETWORK. WE WILL LIBERALISE THE COAL INDUSTRY BY 
TRANSFERRING OWNERSHIP OF COAL RESERVES TO THE CROWN (IN LINE 
WITH OTHER MINERALS), AND ISSUING LICENCES TO OPERATE PITS TO OTHER 
GROUPS, AS WELL AS BRITISH COAL.
 ¥ PROMOTE CONSUMER RIGHTS. WE WILL TAKE THE LEAD WITHIN THE EC 
TO ENSURE THAT ALL PRODUCTS COME WITH ACCURATE, FULL AND SIMPLE 
PRODUCT AND SERVICE INFORMATION. WE WILL GIVE CONSUMER 
WATCHDOGS, INCLUDING THE REGULATORS AND THE STANDARDS 
DEPARTMENTS, GREATER POWERS, AND IMPROVE REDRESS FOR 
INADEQUATE GOODS AND SERVICES.
 ¥ ENCOURAGE DECENTRALISED WAGE BARGAINING. OUR PLANS TO SPREAD 
EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP AND PARTICIPATION WILL ENCOURAGE WAGES TO 
BE SET ACCORDING TO THE PROFITABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL FIRMS RATHER 
THAN TO SOME NATIONAL "GOING RATE". IN ADDITION, WE WILL 
ENCOURAGE MOVES TOWARDS GREATER DECENTRALISATION OF WAGE 
BARGAINING AT COMPANY LEVEL AND, IN THE LONGER TERM AS NATIONAL 
AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENT DEVELOPS, IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. 

SERVING CUSTOMERS

MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE HIGH-
STREET BANKS, HAVE A POOR RECORD OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, FOR 
INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES. IT IS STILL FAR TOO COMMON TO SEE 
CHARGES APPLIED TO ACCOUNTS, OR INTEREST RATES CHANGED, WITHOUT 
CUSTOMERS BEING FULLY INFORMED, AND TO SEE NEW TYPES OF 
ACCOUNTS OPENED WITHOUT EXISTING CUSTOMERS BEING TOLD THAT THEY 
COULD BENEFIT FROM THEM.  
   BANKS WHICH ARE RESPONSIVE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WILL BE GOOD 
FOR THE ECONOMY. WE WILL ENSURE THAT COMMERCIAL BORROWERS ARE 
ENTITLED TO A FULL CONTRACT SPECIFYING THE TERMS, CONDITIONS AND 
DURATION OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED. WE WILL INTRODUCE RIGHTS FOR 
CUSTOMERS OF ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ENSURING THEY ARE FULLY 
INFORMED WHEN CHANGES ARE MADE WHICH DO OR MIGHT AFFECT 
THEM. 

PROMOTING ENTERPRISE

GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO GET THE 
ECONOMY MOVING. BUT LONG-TERM PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE 
PRODUCTION OF HIGH-QUALITY TRADABLE GOODS AND SERVICES IS 
ESSENTIAL FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS. THIS WILL ONLY BE POSSIBLE IF WE 
ENCOURAGE A CLIMATE OF INVESTMENT, ENTERPRISE AND PARTNERSHIP. 
WE WILL:
 ¥ REFORM TAXATION TO INCREASE INVESTMENT. WE WILL INCREASE 
INVESTMENT SUBSTANTIALLY IN SCHEMES SUCH AS SMART TO 
ENCOURAGE INNOVATION IN INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY SMALL AND 
MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVED IN 
MANUFACTURING. WE WILL REFORM CORPORATION TAX AND THE TAXATION 
OF SAVINGS TO ACHIEVE EVEN TREATMENT OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF 
SAVINGS. THIS WILL REDUCE THE CURRENT TAX PENALTIES ON INVESTMENT 
IN INDUSTRY.
 ¥ ENCOURAGE A LONG-TERM APPROACH TO PRIVATE INVESTMENT. WE 
WILL REVERSE THE BURDEN OF PROOF FOR ACQUISITIONS AWAY FROM THE 
TARGET COMPANY TOWARDS THE PREDATOR, AND REQUIRE COMPANIES TO 
BALLOT THEIR SHAREHOLDERS ON BID PLANS. WE WILL REFORM COMPANY 
LAW TO REQUIRE GREATER DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION SUCH AS 
EXPENDITURE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE WILL DEFINE THE 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND INSIST THAT ALL 
PUBLICLY QUOTED COMPANIES HAVE THEM ON THEIR BOARDS.
 ¥ ENCOURAGE SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE SELF-EMPLOYED, AND 
ENSURE A "LEVEL PLAYING FIELD" FOR THEM IN COMPETING WITH THEIR 
LARGER COUNTERPARTS. THIS WILL INCLUDE RELIEVING THE ADMINISTRATIVE 
BURDEN ON SMALL BUSINESSES, LEGISLATING TO MAKE INTEREST PAYABLE 
ON OVERDUE DEBT, AND ENCOURAGING TECS, CHAMBERS OF 
COMMERCE AND LOCAL ENTERPRISE AGENCIES TO REORGANISE TO FORM A 
NETWORK OF BUSINESS LED "ONE-STOP SHOPS". WE WILL ENCOURAGE, 
AND IF NECESSARY LEGISLATE FOR, BANKS TO TREAT SMALL BUSINESSES 
FAIRLY BY AGREEING CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES.
 ¥ ENCOURAGE FLEXIBILITY IN WORKING PATTERNS, INCLUDING PART-TIME 
AND FLEXI-TIME WORK, JOB-SHARING AND HOMEWORKING, ADEQUATE 
BACKUP FOR CARERS OF THE YOUNG OR OLD, AND ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE 
TRAINING. WE WILL ENCOURAGE A NEW SYSTEM OF TAX-FREE CHILD-CARE 
VOUCHERS FOR PARENTS OF CHILDREN UNDER FIVE, GIVEN BY EMPLOYERS 
AND USABLE IN WORKPLACE, LOCAL AUTHORITY AND PRIVATE NURSERIES 
AND FOR INDIVIDUAL QUALIFIED CARERS.
 ¥ SHARE SUCCESS IN INDUSTRY. WE WILL LEGISLATE TO ESTABLISH THE 
RIGHT OF EVERY PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEE IN A SUBSTANTIAL COMPANY 
TO HAVE ACCESS TO A SHARE IN OWNERSHIP AND/OR IN THE PROFITS THEY 
HELP TO CREATE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE PROFIT-RELATED PAY, EMPLOYEE 
SHARE-OWNERSHIP SCHEMES AND EMPLOYEE BUY-OUTS. WE WILL 
RELAUNCH THE COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY.
 ¥ BUILD PARTNERSHIP IN INDUSTRY. WE WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY 
EMPLOYEE HAS A RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN DECISION-MAKING IN THEIR 
ENTERPRISE. WE WILL SET UP A NEW INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIP AGENCY TO 
HELP COMPANIES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES FIND THE PRECISE FORMS OF 
PARTNERSHIP WHICH BEST SUIT THEM. 

CREATING LONG-TERM PROSPERITY

WE WILL CHANGE THE WAYS IN WHICH ECONOMIC POLICY IS MADE AND 
IMPLEMENTED, TO BRING GREATER STABILITY AND A SENSIBLE FRAMEWORK 
TO ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT-ENDING THE PRESENT "BOOM 
BUST"APPROACH. THIS REQUIRES FULLER INTEGRATION WITH THE 
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. OUR KEY CHANGES ARE:
 ¥ ESTABLISHING AN OPERATIONALLY INDEPENDENT BANK OF ENGLAND TO 
BECOME THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE UK, TO ENSURE DISCIPLINED 
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, TO END POLITICAL MANIPULATION OF THE 
ECONOMY AND TO FORM THE ROCK UPON WHICH A LONG-TERM ANTI-
INFLATIONARY STRATEGY CAN BE BUILT. THIS WILL ALSO HELP PROGRESS 
TOWARDS AN INDEPENDENT EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK.
 ¥ MOVING STERLING TO THE NARROW BAND OF THE EUROPEAN EXCHANGE 
RATE MECHANISM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, HELPING STABLE PROGRESS 
TOWARDS LOWER INTEREST RATES.
¥ TAXES AND PUBLIC SPENDING TO BE SET TO REACH A "SAVINGS TARGET" 
FOR THE NATION OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS. WE WILL SET A TARGET AS A 
TOTAL OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC-SECTOR SAVINGS, AND ADJUST FISCAL POLICY 
TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET OVER THE MEDIUM TERM. IF THE COUNTRY DOES 
NOT SAVE ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET WE WILL ALTER TAXES AND 
PUBLIC SPENDING ACCORDINGLY, TO ENSURE ADEQUATE LONG-TERM 
INVESTMENT AND KEEP THE ECONOMY DEVELOPING IN A NON-
INFLATIONARY WAY. WE WILL ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUAL SAVINGS BY 
GIVING TAX RELIEF ON ALL INCOME PAID INTO NEW REGISTERED SAVINGS 
ACCOUNTS.
 ¥ REFORM OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET. WE WILL PUBLISH A DRAFT BUDGET 
FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE FINAL VERSION, TO PROMOTE OPEN 
DISCUSSION OF ECONOMIC AND TAXATION POLICY.THIS WILL FACILITATE 
THE INTEGRATION OF SPENDING AND REVENUE-RAISING, A MEASURE WE 
HAVE LONG ADVOCATED. THIS WILL ALSO MAKE IT EASIER TO MEASURE THE 
IMPACT OF ECONOMIC POLICY ON THE ENVIRONMENT. WE WILL ESTABLISH 
AN INDEPENDENT NATIONAL STATISTICAL COMMISSION TO COLLECT AND 
PUBLISH STATISTICS AND IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY.
 ¥ WORKING TOWARDS EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION, 
INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT EUROPEAN CENTRAL 
BANK AND A SINGLE EUROPEAN CURRENCY. WE WILL RENOUNCE THE 
CONSERVATIVES' MAASTRICHT "OPT-OUT" CLAUSE, ACCEPT THE TIMETABLED 
APPROACH TO EMU, AND RENEGOTIATE THE SOCIAL CHAPTER WITH A 
POSITIVE BRITISH INPUT. 

CHANGING THE ECONOMY FOR GOOD

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS RECOGNISE THAT IF WE ARE TO IMPROVE BRITAIN'S 
DISAPPOINTING ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE 
GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM WHICH PRODUCES IT. OUR PROPOSALS FOR 
ELECTORAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM ARE A PREREQUISITE FOR BETTER 
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WILL PRODUCE 
GREATER STABILITY IN GOVERNMENT, ENDING THE ECONOMIC DISRUPTION 
CAUSED BY SUDDEN SHARP SWINGS IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES BEFORE 
AND AFTER ELECTIONS. HOME RULE AND DECENTRALISATION WILL ENSURE 
THAT ECONOMIC POWER AND PROSPERITY IS SPREAD THROUGHOUT 
BRITAIN. INTEGRATION WITHIN EUROPE WILL CREATE THE FRAMEWORK FOR 
LONG-TERM ECONOMIC STRENGTH. FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION 
AND OPEN GOVERNMENT WILL IMPROVE COMPETITION AND ENCOURAGE 
INFORMED DEBATE. A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION WILL ENSURE THAT 
POLITICIANS CAN NO LONGER IGNORE LONG-TERM PRIORITIES FOR SHORT-
TERM EXPEDIENCY AND POLITICAL ADVANTAGE. 

CHILDCARE VOUCHERS

BRITAIN SERIOUSLY LAGS BEHIND ITS CONTINENTAL NEIGHBOURS IN 
PROVISION FOR CHILD CARE FOR WORKING PARENTS. THIS NOT ONLY 
UNFAIRLY IMPEDES OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE CONCERNED. IT HOLDS 
BACK THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY OF MANY HIGHLY SKILLED 
WORKERS.  
   WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE INTRODUCTION OF A SYSTEM OF CHILD CARE 
VOUCHERS, PROVIDED BY EMPLOYERS TO PARENTS WITH CHILDREN UNDER 
SCHOOL AGE. THEY WILL BE USABLE TO PAY FOR CHILD CARE IN A RANGE 
OF PLACES-WORKPLACE, LOCAL AUTHORITY OR PRIVATE NURSERIES, PLAY 
GROUPS OR BY INDIVIDUAL QUALIFIED CARERS. THE PARENT WILL CHOOSE, 
TOPPING UP THE VALUE IF THEY WISH. CHILD CARE VOUCHERS WILL BE 
DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES FOR THE EMPLOYERS AND TAX FREE FOR THE 
PARENTS. SELF-EMPLOYED PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO PURCHASE VOUCHERS 
AND RECEIVE SIMILAR TAX ADVANTAGES. IN DUE COURSE THE PRINCIPLE 
COULD BE EXTENDED TO COVER CHILD CARE FOR OLDER CHILDREN. 

2. BRITAIN'S ENVIRONMENT: ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION AND
CONSERVATION

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE DETERMINED TO ENSURE THAT BRITAIN CHANGES 
ITS WAYS SO THAT IT BECOMES A LEADER, NOT A LAGGARD, IN FACING THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE. POLLUTERS WILL PAY AND CONSERVERS WILL 
BE REWARDED. TAXATION WILL BE GRADUALLY SHIFTED FROM THE THINGS 
WE WANT MORE OF-INCOME, SAVINGS AND VALUE ADDED-TO THE 
THINGS WE WANT LESS OF: POLLUTION AND RESOURCE DEPLETION.  
   THE ACCELERATING DESTRUCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT IS ONE OF THE 
MOST SERIOUS CHALLENGES WE FACE TODAY. ITS SYMPTOMS ARE 
BECOMING CLEARER WITH EVERY YEAR, FROM GLOBAL WARMING AND 
HOLES IN THE OZONE LAYER TO POISONED RIVERS AND POLLUTED AIR AT 
HOME. THEY THREATEN NOT JUST OUR ABILITY TO ENJOY OUR TOWNS AND 
COUNTRYSIDE BUT OUR HEALTH AND OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS AIM TO CUT POLLUTION AND CLEAN UP THE LOCAL 
ENVIRONMENT.  
   WE AIM TO BUILD A SOCIETY THAT DOES NOT CREATE WEALTH AT THE 
EXPENSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. OUR ECONOMY CURRENTLY FUNCTIONS 
UNSUSTAINABLY, PRODUCING UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF POLLUTION AND 
RATES OF RESOURCE DEPLETION. WE WILL CREATE NEW INCENTIVES TO 
FOLLOW ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE STRATEGIES AND BEHAVIOUR. 

PROTECTING OUR HERITAGE

CONSERVING AND ENHANCING THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, COUNTRYSIDE 
AND TOWNSCAPE ALIKE, IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE TO EVERYONE'S 
QUALITY OF LIFE. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL: 
¥ IMPROVE COUNTRYSIDE. PROTECTION POLICIES FOR NATIONAL PARKS. 
HERITAGE COASTS, AREAS OF OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY, AND SITES OF 
SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC INTEREST. WE WILL TIGHTEN CONTROLS AGAINST 
EXPLOITATION, WE WILL CREATE MORE NATIONAL PARKS AND WE WILL 
IMPROVE ACCESS TO THE COUNTRYSIDE.
 ¥ INTRODUCE COUNTRYSIDE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR FARMERS 
AND LANDOWNERS WHO WISH TO TAKE THEM UP. THESE WILL BE DRAWN 
UP IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOCAL PLANNING AUTHORITIES WITH THE AIM OF 
MANAGING THE COUNTRYSIDE TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, 
SAFEGUARD PLANT AND ANIMAL WILDLIFE, AND PRESERVE TRADITIONAL 
LANDSCAPE FEATURES, SUCH AS WOODS, HEDGEROWS AND DRY-STONE 
WALLS.
 ¥ REFORM LAND USE PLANNING SO THAT THE PROTECTION OF THE NATURAL 
ENVIRONMENT BECOMES A MAJOR FEATURE OF THE PLANNING SYSTEM. 
WE WILL DECENTRALISE PLANNING DECISIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, 
GIVING A KEY ROLE TO THE LOCAL PLAN DRAWN UP BY THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITY.
 ¥ CLEAN UP THE CITIES. WE WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSPORT, REDUCE 
TRAFFIC CONGESTION, AND ENCOURAGE PEDESTRIANISATION AND CYCLING 
SCHEMES. WE WILL ENCOURAGE MORE PARKS, GARDENS AND GREEN 
SPACES. WE WILL PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES FOR COUNCILS TO DEAL WITH 
NOISE COMPLAINTS AND MAKE COMPENSATION FOR EXCESSIVE 
COMMERCIAL NOISE MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE.
 ¥ PROMOTE BETTER WASTE MANAGEMENT. WE WILL PROVIDE GRANTS FOR 
RECYCLING SCHEMES, INTRODUCE REGULATIONS ON THE USE OF 
PACKAGING MATERIALS, AND ENCOURAGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO CLEAN UP 
LITTER. WE WILL CLEAN UP BEACHES AND COASTLINES BY ENSURING FULL 
TREATMENT OF SEWAGE.
 ¥ IMPROVE STANDARDS OF ANIMAL PROTECTION. WE WILL SET UP AN 
ANIMAL PROTECTION COMMISSION TO ENFORCE AND RECOMMEND 
CHANGES TO LEGISLATION. WE WILL PHASE OUT BATTERY CAGES AND 
UNACCEPTABLE SYSTEMS OF FACTORY FARMING, TIGHTEN CONTROLS ON THE 
EXPORT OF LIVE ANIMALS FOR SLAUGHTER, AND ESTABLISH A DOG 
REGISTRATION SCHEME. WE WILL PROHIBIT EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING PAIN 
OR DISTRESS FOR NON-MEDICAL AND NON-VETERINARY PURPOSES, 
PROMOTE ALTERNATIVES TO THE USE OF ANIMALS IN RESEARCH AND 
EDUCATION, AND ENSURE THAT LAWS AGAINST BADGER-BAITING AND DOG-
FIGHTING ARE ENFORCED.ON HUNTING WITH HOUNDS, LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS AS A PARTY HAVE DECLARED THEIR OPPOSITION, BUT 
RECOGNISE, LIKE THE CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR PARTIES, THAT 
LEGISLATION IS A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL MP. 

CONTROLLING POLLUTION

WE WILL USE MARKET MECHANISMS, WHERE FEASIBLE, TO REDUCE 
POLLUTION BY ENSURING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND BENEFITS ARE 
FED INTO THE ECONOMY. DIRECT CONTROLS WILL STILL BE NEEDED IN SOME 
CASES. WE WILL: ¥ SET TARGETS FOR CUTTING POLLUTION. THESE INCLUDE 
A 30 PER CENT REDUCTION IN CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM THE UK 
BY THE YEAR 2005; OUR ENERGY POLICY IS GEARED TO THIS TARGET. WE 
WILL BAN THE USE OF CFCS AND HALONS BY 1994.
 ¥ INTRODUCE A SYSTEM OF TRADABLE EMISSION LICENCES. WE WILL 
ISSUE FACTORIES AND POWER STATIONS WITH LICENCES SETTING A CEILING 
ON PERMITTED EMISSIONS OF POLLUTANTS SUCH AS SULPHUR DIOXIDE. 
THESE WILL BE TRADABLE: THOSE WHO ARE MOST EFFICIENT AT REDUCING 
POLLUTION WOULD HAVE SURPLUS LICENCES WHICH THEY COULD THEN SELL 
EITHER TO THOSE LESS EFFICIENT, OR BACK TO GOVERNMENT. THE TARGETS 
FOR EMISSIONS-AND THEREFORE NUMBER OF LICENCES AVAILABLE-WILL 
BE REDUCED YEAR BY YEAR, LEADING TO A STEADY FALL IN POLLUTION.
 ¥ CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES WITH SOLE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, LEAVING THE 
DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT TO COVER LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND 
HOUSING. WE WILL SET UP AN INDEPENDENT AND POWERFUL 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY TO WORK WITH THE NEW EUROPEAN 
ENVIRONMENT AGENCY. 
¥ PUT FORWARD PLANS FOR A POWERFUL UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT 
PROGRAMME TO LEAD GLOBAL EFFORT S TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT, 
OPERATING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN  "EARTH CHARTER" . WE WISH 
TO SEE A WORLD MARKET IN TRADABLE EMISSION LICENCES FOR CARBON 
DIOXIDE AND OTHER POLLUTANTS. THIS WOULD NOT ONLY PROVIDE 
INCENTIVES TO CUT POLLUTION BUT ALSO ACT AS A CHANNEL FOR 
TRANSFERRING RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. 

CONSERVING ENERGY

WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE ENERGY POLICY, GOVERNMENT CANNOT HAVE AN 
EFFECTIVE ENVIRONMENT POLICY. BRITAIN'S NATIONAL ENERGY STRATEGY 
MUST BE SET WITHIN AN OVERALL EUROPEAN FRAMEWORK, WITH THE AIM 
OF REDUCING POLLUTION, IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND BOOSTING 
THE USE OF RENEWABLES. WE WILL:
¥ SUPPORT A COMMUNITY-WIDE ENERGY TAX ON ALL ENERGY SOURCES. 
THIS WILL BE RELATED TO LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMITTED AND WILL 
PROVIDE A STRONG INCENTIVE FOR SAVING ENERGY AND INVESTING IN 
CLEANER SOURCES. EXTRA REVENUE RAISED THROUGH THE TAX WILL BE FED 
BACK INTO THE ECONOMY REDUCING OTHER TAXES SUCH AS VAT AND BY 
PROTECTING THOSE LEAST ABLE TO ADAPT TO THE HIGHER PRICE OF ENERGY.
 ¥ INVEST IN ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY. WE WILL SET NEW 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR HOMES,  OFFICES AND FACTORIES, 
AND FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS LIGHT BULBS, FRIDGES AND COOKERS.WE 
WILL GIVE GRANTS FOR HOME INSULATION AND THE INSTALLATION OF SOLAR 
PANELS, AND INTRODUCE ENERGY AUDITS OF BUILDINGS. WE WILL 
ENCOURAGE COMBINED HEAT AND POWER AND DISTRICT HEATING 
SCHEMES.
 ¥ DOUBLE GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH. 
WE WILL ESTABLISH A RENEWABLE ENERGY  OFFICE TO PROMOTE 
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION, IN PARTICULAR OF WAVE 
POWER, HOT ROCKS GEOTHERMAL ENERGY, PASSIVE SOLAR DESIGN OF 
BUILDINGS, SMALL-SCALE HYDROPOWER SCHEMES AND WIND ENERGY. 
WE WILL COMPLETE THE STUDY ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SEVERN 
BARRAGE.
START TO PHASE OUT NUCLEAR FISSION STATIONS, WHICH ARE 
PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AND POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS~ WE AIM TO 
COMPLETE THE PHASE-OUT AT THE LATEST BY THE YEAR 2020 (AND EARLIER 
IF FEASIBLE), AND WE WILL NOT PROCEED FURTHER WITH THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE SIZEWELL B PWR. WE WILL CONTINUE NUCLEAR 
RESEARCH, BUT AT A LOWER COST. REPROCESSING SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL 
RODS INCREASES THE VOLUME OF WASTE AND SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN 
ONLY WHEN NECESSARY FOR SAFETY REASONS.  
  WE AIM TO BUILD A SOCIETY THAT DOES NOT CREATE WEALTH AT THE 
EXPENSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. WE WILL CREATE NEW INCENTIVES TO 
FOLLOW ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE STRATEGIES AND BEHAVIOUR. 

  AIR POLLUTION INDEX

AIR POLLUTION THREATENS THE HEALTH OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE-
PARTICULARLY CHILDREN, ELDERLY PEOPLE AND ANYONE WITH A 
RESPIRATORY PROBLEM SUCH AS ASTHMA. GOVERNMENT MONITORING 
STATIONS MEASURE LEVELS OF POLLUTANTS SUCH AS NITROGEN OXIDES OR 
LOW-LEVEL OZONE BUT FAIL TO PUBLICISE THEM WIDELY. WHEN LEVELS 
EXCEED WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION GUIDELINES, THE RESULT IS 
DESCRIBED AS "GOOD"-IN OTHER COUNTRIES IT WOULD BE CALLED 
"POOR".   
  WE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MONITORING STATIONS, ENSURING 
THAT ALL MAJOR URBAN AREAS ARE COVERED. WE WILL PUBLISH A REGULAR 
AIR POLLUTION INDEX AND ENCOURAGE NEWSPAPERS AND TV AND RADIO 
WEATHER FORECASTS TO USE IT. THIS WILL INCREASE PUBLIC 
CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE POLLUTION ISSUE AND PROVE OF REAL BENEFIT TO 
THE HEALTH OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE. 

MAKING TRANSPORT CLEAN AND EFFICIENT

BY EXPANDING THE PROVISION AND QUALITY OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND 
REDUCING SOCIETY'S DEPENDENCE ON THE PRIVATE CAR, WE WILL 
IMPROVE TRAVEL EFFICIENCY AND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. WE WILL 
ACHIEVE THIS BY:
 ¥ INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT, INCREASING ITS FREQUENCY OF 
SERVICE, SPEED AND SAFETY, AND REDUCING ITS COST TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL-ESPECIALLY IN ISOLATED RURAL AREAS WHERE THE NEED IS 
GREATEST. WE WILL ENCOURAGE NEW SCHEMES, USING LIGHT RAILWAYS 
AND TRAMS IN CITIES. WE WILL REQUIRE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO DEFINE 
MINIMUM STANDARDS OF ACCESSIBILITY IN THEIR AREAS AND DRAW UP 
TRANSPORT PLANS WHICH MEET THEM.
 ¥ IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE RAIL NETWORK, ALLOWING MORE 
MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND PASSENGERS BY RAIL AND LESS 
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. WE WILL CONSTRUCT A HIGH-SPEED LINK FROM 
THE CHANNEL TUNNEL TO CONNECT WITH THE MAJOR RAIL ROUTES TO THE 
NORTH AND WEST, AND EXTEND ELECTRIFICATION THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY. WE OPPOSE THE PRIVATISATION OF BRITISH RAIL, BUT WILL 
ALLOW PRIVATE OPERATORS ACCESS TO THE RAIL NETWORK, WHILE GIVING 
BR THE FREEDOM TO RAISE INVESTMENT CAPITAL ON THE OPEN MARKET.
 ¥ A REDUCTION IN FUEL CONSUMPTION. ALL POLITICAL PARTIES ACCEPT 
THAT LONG-TERM INCREASES IN PETROL PRICES ARE NOT ONLY 
ENVIRONMENTALLY NECESSARY BUT UNAVOIDABLE. WE WILL PHASE THESE 
IN GRADUALLY BY APPLYING OUR ENERGY TAX TO PETROL, WHILE AT THE 
SAME TIME GRADUATING VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY AND CAR TAX ACCORDING 
TO FUEL EFFICIENCY-SO THAT THE MOST EFFICIENT VEHICLES PAY LEAST. 
THESE PRICE INCREASES WILL NOT BE BROUGHT IN UNLESS AND UNTIL 
COMPENSATION SCHEMES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES 
WHICH HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE TO THE USE OF CARS ARE READY TO BE 
INTRODUCED. WE WILL SCRAP THE REMAINING TAX BREAKS FOR COMPANY 
CARS AND APPLY TOUGHER LIMITS TO PERMITTED EMISSIONS.
 ¥ ASSISTING PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS BY MAKING CONCESSIONARY FARES 
ON LOCAL PUBLIC TRANSPORT WIDELY AVAILABLE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE 
USE OF VILLAGE MINIBUSES, "POST AND PASSENGER" BUSES AND TAXI 
SERVICES. PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO ALTERNATIVES TO PRIVATE CARS WILL BE 
HELPED BY OUR PLANS TO GRADUATE VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY AND BY 
SPECIFIC TARGET MEASURES TO HELP ISOLATED COMMUNITIES.
 ¥ ACTION AGAINST TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN URBAN AREAS. WE WILL 
ENCOURAGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO INTRODUCE PEAK-HOUR BANS ON CARS, 
TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES CAR-SHARING SCHEMES AND FURTHER 
PEDESTRIANISATION. WE WILL INTRODUCE A VARIETY OF ROAD-PRICING 
SCHEMES, IN WHICH MOTORISTS PAY TO USE HIGHLY CONGESTED ROADS 
AT BUSY TIMES OF THE DAY.
 ¥ NEW PRIORITIES FOR ROAD BUILDING. WE WILL APPROVE MOTORWAY 
OR TRUNK ROAD INVESTMENTS ONLY WHERE IT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED THAT 
ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORT PROVISION CANNOT MEET THE NEED AT LOWER 
ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENT COST. ESSENTIAL NEW ROADS AND 
IMPROVEMENTS WILL STILL PROCEED BUT THE CREATION OF A "LEVEL 
PLAYING FIELD" IN DECISION-MAKING BETWEEN RAIL AND ROAD WILL 
ENSURE SOME SWITCH OF PASSENGER AND FREIGHT TRANSPORT TO THE 
RAILWAYS.
 ¥ THE EXPANSION OF AIRPORTS OUTSIDE THE SOUTH EAST WHILE AT THE 
SAME TIME FREEZING FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AT GATWICK AND 
STANSTED.
 ¥ REVERSING THE DECLINE IN THE MERCHANT FLEET. FOR ECONOMIC AND 
DEFENCE REASONS, WE WILL BOOST BRITISH SHIPPING AND PROMOTE 
RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING FOR THE MERCHANT NAVY. ¥ ENVIRONMENTAL 
PLANNING POLICIES. WE WILL INTRODUCE PLANNING POLICIES WHICH 
WILL ENCOURAGE THE BUILDING OF HOMES NEAR WORKPLACES, LEISURE 
FACILITIES, SHOPS AND OTHER SERVICES. WHERE THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT MUST BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE 
USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO DECENTRALISE WORK. 

WATER DISTRICT DISCOUNT

ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT, WATER BILLS WILL RISE BY 50 PER CENT 
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. FOR MANY HOUSEHOLDS (IN WALES, FOR 
EXAMPLE), WATER BILLS ARE NOW HIGHER THAN BILLS FOR ALL LOCAL 
PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT PAY THEIR WATER BILLS.     AT PRESENT WATER 
COMPANIES HAVE A BULK SUPPLY DISCOUNT FOR COMMERCIAL 
CUSTOMERS-A "WHOLESALE PRICE" FOR THEIR WATER. LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS WILL ALTER THE LICENSING CONDITIONS FOR WATER 
COMPANIES TO EXTEND THIS TO GROUPS OF DOMESTIC CONSUMERS WHO 
LIVE ON LARGE ESTATES AND IN SHELTERED HOUSING COMPLEXES THIS 
DISTRICT DISCOUNT WILL KEEP DOWN BILLS FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE AND 
MANY LOW-INCOME INNER-CITY RESIDENTS LIVING ON LARGE ESTATES. 

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS AIM TO BUILD AN ECONOMY WHICH IS NOT ONLY 
COMPETITIVE AND ENTERPRISING BUT ALSO ENVIRONMENTALLY 
SUSTAINABLE, LEAVING FUTURE GENERATIONS A WEALTH INHERITANCE-OF 
KNOWLEDGE, TECHNOLOGY, CAPITAL AND ENVIRONMENT ASSETS-AT LEAST 
AS GREAT AS THAT INHERITED BY THE CURRENT GENERATION. OUR 
PROPOSALS ARE:
 ¥ A BETTER METHOD OF MEASURING ECONOMIC PROGRESS. THE 
CONVENTIONAL TARGET OF GROWTH IN GDP IS A POOR INDICATOR 
PROGRESS. WE WILL MODIFY GDP BY INCORPORATING MEASUREMENTS 
OF POLLUTION AND RESOURCE DEPLETION TO CREATE A FIGURE FOR 
SUSTAINABLE NATIONAL INCOME. WE WILL ALSO USE INDICATORS OF SOCIAL 
AND PERSONAL QUALITY OF LIFE SUCH AS CHANGES IN LIFE EXPECTANCY, 
IITERACY RATES AND EDUCATION ATTAINMENTS TO GIVE A BETTER MEASURE 
OF PROGRESS. THE PRIME MINISTER WILL PRESENT AN ANNUAL REPORT ON 
CHANGES IN THESE INDICATORS TO PARLIAMENT.
 ¥ A SYSTEM OF ENVIRONMENTAL INCENTIVES AND PENALTIES. WE WILL 
MAKE AVAILABLE GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY 
ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS HOME INSULATION, AND TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AND 
INDUSTRY ADJUST TO OUR NEW STRICTER STANDARDS FOR POLLUTION 
CONTROL. WE WILL PENALISE ACTIVITIES WHICH HARM THE ENVIRONMENT 
OR DEPLETE STOCKS OF RAW MATERIALS THROUGH TAXATION, SO THAT 
PRICES REFLECT THE DAMAGE THEY DO. OUR NEW ENERGY TAX IS THIS 
MANIFESTO'S KEY PROPOSAL IN THIS AREA. THE REVENUE RAISED WILL BE 
USED TO REDUCE OTHER TAXES SUCH AS VAT. 
¥ ENABLE CONSUMERS TO IDENTIFY AND CHOOSE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS. 
WE WILL INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCT LABELS, SHOWING INFORMATION 
SUCH AS ENERGY CONSUMPTION DURING USE AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
IMPACT OF THE PRODUCTION PROCESS. WE WILL INTRODUCE STRICT 
STANDARDS OF LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR CONSUMER DURABLES AND 
ENCOURAGE DEPOSIT-REFUND SCHEMES. WE WILL IMPROVE RECYCLING 
AND WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE ENVIRONMENTAL 
AUDITS FOR COMPANIES, SHOWING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THEIR 
ACTIVITIES. 

REVIVING RURAL COMMUNITIES

OUR POLICY FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE AIMS BOTH TO PROTECT BRITAIN'S 
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND TO RECREATE SUCCESS IN ONE OF BRITAIN'S 
GREATEST INDUSTRIES, AGRICULTURE. THE FARMING INDUSTRY IS PASSING 
THROUGH A PERIOD OF PROFOUND CHANGE; MOST FARMERS RECOGNISE 
THAT THE INDUSTRY MUST ACHIEVE A BETTER BALANCE WITH THE MARKET 
AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WE WILL HELP THIS TRANSITION BY:
 ¥ WORKING FOR FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL 
POLICY. WE WANT TO EASE THE ADJUSTMENT FROM THE PRESENT PRICE 
SUPPORT MECHANISM TOWARDS MARKET PRICES AND DIRECT SUPPORT 
AIMED AT ASSISTING THE FARMING INDUSTRY IN TRANSITION AND AT 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL GOALS. THESE WILL BE FUNDED BY SAVINGS 
MADE OUT OF THE PRESENT INTERVENTION MECHANISMS OF THE CAP.
 ¥ NEW INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES, IN 
PARTICULAR FOR EXTENSIFYING FOOD PRODUCTION (USING LAND LESS 
INTENSIVELY), AND REDUCED-INPUT AND ORGANIC FARMING. 
COUNTRYSIDE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS, DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE A 
KEY FEATURE IN THIS SHIFT OF CAP RESOURCES FROM PRICE SUPPORT TO 
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.
 ¥ REFORMED SYSTEMS OF DIRECT SUPPORT, AIMED IN PARTICULAR AT 
HELPING FAMILY FARMS AND CROFTS.
 ¥ INTRODUCING RENEWABLE LIMITED-TERM TENANCIES FOR AGRICULTURAL 
LAND, ENCOURAGING NEW ENTRANTS TO FARMING. WE WILL ENCOURAGE 
LOCAL COUNCILS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SMALLHOLDINGS AND TO 
INTRODUCE PART-TIME HOLDINGS FOR NEW ENTRANTS.
 ¥ EXPANDING FORESTRY. WE SUPPORT THE LONG-TERM AIM OF 
DOUBLING THE AREA OF THE UK UNDER FORESTRY, BUT THIS MUST 
INCLUDE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF BROAD-LEAFED HARDWOODS. WE 
OPPOSE THE PRIVATISATION OF THE FORESTRY COMMISSION. WE WILL 
CREATE MORE COMMUNITY FORESTS NEAR LARGE TOWNS. ¥ ENCOURAGING 
FISHING AND FISH FARMING. WE WILL IMPROVE THE GOVERNMENT'S 
DECOMMISSIONING PROPOSALS AND APPRAISE WITH THE INDUSTRY, 
EFFECTIVE TECHNICAL CONSERVATION MEASURES. WE SHOULD MOVE 
TOWARDS FISHERIES ;LICENSING AND MANAGEMENT ON A MORE REGIONAL 
BASIS TO HELP TRADITIONAL FISHING COMMUNITIES AND PROTECT THOSE 
WHO FISH SUSTAINABLY, SUCH AS MACKEREL HANDLINERS. WE WILL 
TRANSFER FULL PLANNING RESPONSIBILITY FOR FISH FARMING TO LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES, AND WE WILL INCREASE RESEARCH INTO THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
ASPECTS OF FISH FARMING AND DIVERSIFICATION. WE WILL WORK WITH 
THE EC TO COUNTER THE DUMPING OF STOCKS INTO THE COMMUNITY.
¥THE EXTENSION OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. THESE WILL BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSIFICATION, IN 
PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE PRIVATE AND VOLUNTARY 
SECTORS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES.
 ¥ TOUGHER ACTION ON FOOD SAFETY. WE WILL TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR FOOD STANDARDS FROM THE AGRICULTURE MINISTRY TO A NEW FOOD 
AND DRUGS COMMISSION. WE WILL BRING IN MUCH TIGHTER LABELLING 
REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL FOODS, AND MAKE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR FOOD 
RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENTS. WE WILL IMPROVE 
CONSUMER REPRESENTATION ON GOVERNMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEES.

 3. BRITAIN'S SKILLS: EXCELLENCE FOR ALL

BRITAIN'S CITIZENS ARE OUR GREATEST ASSET. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL 
INVEST IN PEOPLE TO ENABLE EVERY INDIVIDUAL TO FULFIL THEIR 
POTENTIAL, AND, IN SO DOING, BUILD THE NATION'S ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIAL STRENGTH, WE AIM TO CREATE A FIRST-CLASS EDUCATION SYSTEM 
FOR ALL, NOT JUST BY PROVIDING ADEQUATE PUBLIC FUNDING, BUT ALSO 
THROUGH REFORMS WHICH INCREASE CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR EACH 
CITIZEN. 
    LIBERAL DEMOCRATS START FROM THE BELIEF THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL, 
WHATEVER THEIR AGE, SEX, BACKGROUND OR ABILITY, POSSESSES A 
UNIQUE POTENTIAL AND A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO OFFER SOCIETY OUR 
TARGET IS EXCELLENCE FOR ALL. THIS REQUIRES MORE RELEVANT COURSES, 
HIGHER STANDARDS AND IMPROVED PROVISION. EXCELLENCE ALSO HAS A 
COST. WE WILL GUARANTEE THAT LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL INCREASE 
INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION BY ~2 BILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR, EVEN 
THOUGH THIS WILL REQUIRE AN EXTRA PENNY IN THE POUND ON INCOME 
TAX. OUR PRIORITIES FOR INVESTMENT ARE PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION, 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR 16-19 YEAR OLDS, AND ADULT EDUCATION. 
   
 AIMING HIGH; RAISING STANDARDS

OUR AIM IS SIMPLE-TO GIVE BRITAIN A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION 
SYSTEM, IN WHICH HIGH QUALITY IS THE KEY, BY THE YEAR 2000. WE 
WILL: 
¥ CREATE THE FRAMEWORK FOR HIGH STANDARDS BY ESTABLISHING A 
SINGLE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING WITH OVERSIGHT OF ALL 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING. WE WILL SET UP A NATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS 
COUNCIL TO COORDINATE A SINGLE SYSTEM OF ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL 
COURSES FOR 14-19 YEAR OLDS, AND A NEW HIGHER EDUCATION 
STANDARDS COUNCIL TO MONITOR QUALITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION.
 ¥ IMPROVE INSPECTIONS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT A FULLY INDEPENDENT 
HM INSPECTORATE OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING, PROPERLY STAFFED 
AND FUNDED, REPORTS ON THE ENTIRE RANGE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
PROVISION FROM PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION TO UNIVERSITIES. LOCAL 
INSPECTORS OF SCHOOLS WILL BE ANSWERABLE TO THE INSPECTORATE, 
WHICH WILL ALSO HAVE A NEW ROLE AS EDUCATION OMBUDSMAN. WE 
WILL CARRY OUT A SCHOOL BUILDINGS AUDIT ALONGSIDE THE REGULAR FOUR-
YEARLY LOCAL SCHOOL INSPECTION, TO ASSESS THE PHYSICAL STATE OF 
SCHOOLS AND EQUIPMENT. WE WILL REINSTATE THE BUILDINGS STANDARDS 
SUSPENDED IN 1989. 
¥ SUPPORT TEACHERS. WE WILL SET UP A STATUTORY GENERAL TEACHING 
COUNCIL TO IMPROVE PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS AND SET STANDARDS 
FOR TEACHER TRAINING AND RETRAINING. WE WILL IMPROVE PROVISION 
FOR IN-SERVICE TRAINING AND CAREER BREAKS FOR WOMEN TEACHERS 
WITH CHILDREN. WE SUPPORTED THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TEACHERS' 
PAY REVIEW BODY AND BELIEVE IT WILL ENSURE THAT TEACHERS ARE 
PROPERLY REWARDED. 
   
 PUTTING EDUCATION AT THE HEART OF THE COMMUNITY

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS PIONEERED LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF SCHOOLS. NOW 
WE AIM TO INCREASE FURTHER THE DAY-TO-DAY INDEPENDENCE OF 
SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WITHIN A DEMOCRATICALLY ACCOUNTABLE 
FRAMEWORK OF LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES. THIS INCLUDES:
 ¥ A NEW INDEPENDENCE FOR SCHOOLS AND FURTHER EDUCATION 
COLLEGES. WE WILL GIVE SCHOOLS INCREASED ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT 
IN RETURN FOR THE WIDER OPENING OF THEIR FACILITIES TO THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITY. WE WILL FULLY FUND INDIVIDUAL TEACHER COSTS. WE WILL 
ENCOURAGE EVERY SCHOOL TO ENHANCE ITS CHARACTER. ETHOS AND AREAS 
OF SPECIAL INTEREST WITHIN A MORE FLEXIBLE NATIONAL CURRICULUM 
FRAMEWORK. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT OF GREATER FREEDOM FOR ALL 
SCHOOLS, WE WILL END THE TWO-TIER SYSTEM CREATED BY GRANT 
MAINTAINED SCHOOLS AND CITY TECHNOLOGY COLLEGES BY RETURNING 
THEM TO THE STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK OF THE LOCAL ELECTED 
EDUCATION AUTHORITY. STRATEGIC RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADULT AND FURTHER 
EDUCATION WILL REMAIN WITH THE LEA. LEA REPRESENTATIVES ON 
SCHOOL GOVERNING BODIES WILL REFLECT FAIRLY THE POLITICAL BALANCE OF 
THE AUTHORITY.
 ¥ A NEW ROLE FOR LOCAL DEMOCRACY. WE WILL REQUIRE LEAS TO 
GUARANTEE A SUITABLE PLACE, WITH PROPER SUPPORT, FOR EVERY CHILD 
IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING UP TO THE AGE OF 19. THIS WILL INCLUDE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THAT SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES MEET THE 
HIGHEST STANDARDS OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, DISCIPLINE AND 
BEHAVIOUR, AND FOR PROVIDING SPECIAL SERVICES FOR SCHOOLS, SUCH 
AS PERIPATETIC MUSIC, LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT, OR BEHAVIOUR 
SUPPORT. PUBLISHED INFORMATION ABOUT SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WILL 
RECOGNISE ACHIEVEMENT ON THE BASIS OF "EDUCATION VALUE 
ADDED"-PROGRESS MADE BY PUPILS-RATHER THAN CRUDE "LEAGUE 
TABLES" OF RESULTS.
 ¥ INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS. WE RECOGNISE THE CONTRIBUTION TO 
EXCELLENCE WHICH THE BEST OF THESE SCHOOLS MAKE, AND THE RIGHT OF 
THOSE WHO WISH TO PAY FOR PRIVATE EDUCATION TO DO SO, BUT THIS 
SHOULD NOT BE SUBSIDISED FROM PUBLIC RESOURCES. WE WILL PHASE 
OUT THE ASSISTED PLACES SCHEME WITHOUT AFFECTING THOSE ALREADY IN 
IT, AND RESTORE THE MONEY SAVED TO STATE SCHOOLS. WE WILL REVIEW 
THE CHARITABLE STATUS OF INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS WITH THE INTENTION OF 
ENSURING THAT THE BENEFITS OF CHARITABLE STATUS ARE ONLY AWARDED TO 
THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE A GENUINE CONTRIBUTION TO THE WIDER 
COMMUNITY. 
   
 OPENING SCHOOLS TO THE COMMUNITY

SCHOOLS SHOULD BE SEEN AS A VALUABLE RESOURCE, NOT JUST FOR THEIR 
PUPILS BUT FOR THE COMMUNITIES AROUND THEM. ACCESS TO THEIR 
LIBRARIES, COMPUTERS. MEETINGS ROOMS, SPORTS HALLS, PLAYING 
FIELDS AND SWIMMING POOLS COULD MAKE A BIG CONTRIBUTION TO 
COMMUNITY LIFE.
WE WILL ENCOURAGE ALL SCHOOLS TO OPEN UP THESE FACILITIES TO LOCAL 
PEOPLE IN THE EVENINGS, AT WEEKENDS AND IN THE SCHOOL HOLIDAYS. 
SOME OF OUR PROPOSED EXPANSION OF ADULT EDUCATION WILL BE 
ORGANISED IN THIS WAY. LOCAL AUTHORITIES-PARTICULARLY 
COMMUNITY COUNCILS WHERE THEY EXIST-WILL HELP TO PROVIDE THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT NEEDED TO MANAGE SUCH OPEN ACCESS. 

EDUCATING THE INDIVIDUAL

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN RECEIVE 
HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE FROM 
BEFORE SCHOOL TO RETIREMENT. BUT THE CURRENT SYSTEM PLACES TOO 
LITTLE EMPHASIS ON VOCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS. WE WILL:
 ¥ GUARANTEE PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION FOR EVERY CHILD. WE WILL 
GUARANTEE EVERY CHILD ACCESS TO TWO YEARS' PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION 
WITH A CHOICE OF PRE-SCHOOL PROVISION.
 ¥ INTRODUCE A NATIONAL RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT. WE WILL ENSURE 
THAT EVERY PUPIL HAS A NATIONAL RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT SO THAT 
PROGRESS IS PROPERLY DOCUMENTED AND SHARED BETWEEN PARENTS 
AND SCHOOLS. SUPPLEMENTED BY INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, THIS 
WILL REPLACE THE CURRENT STANDARD ASSESSMENT TASKS IN ORDER TO 
RAISE STANDARDS. 
¥ REDUCE CLASS SIZES. WE AIM TO REDUCE MAXIMUM CLASS SIZES SO 
THAT NO REGISTRATION CLASS IN THE COUNTRY NEED HAVE MORE THAN 30 
PUPILS.
 ¥ REWARD ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS. OUR NEW 
NATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS COUNCIL WILL DEVELOP A MODULAR, CREDIT-
BASED COURSE AND EXAMINATION STRUCTURE FOR THE 14-19 AGE GROUP, 
COVERING BOTH VOCATIONAL AND ACADEMIC COURSES. THIS WILL BUILD 
ON A SIMPLER, MORE FLEXIBLE NATIONAL CURRICULUM AND A REVISED AND 
EXTENDED SYSTEM OF NATIONAL CURRICULUM LEVELS. PUPILS FROM THE 
AGE OF 14 WILL STUDY A BALANCED CURRICULUM AROUND A CORE OF 
MATHS, ENGLISH, SCIENCE AND A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, ADDING 
SPECIALISMS IN ACADEMIC, VOCATIONAL OR TECHNICAL COURSES, SOME 
DELIVERED BY EMPLOYERS M THE WORKPLACE. WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL 
14-19 YEAR OLDS HAVE A PERSONAL TUTOR AND CAREERS ADVICE, HELPING 
THEM BUILD THE FOUNDATIONS FOR PERSONAL FULFILMENT AND SUCCESS.
 ¥ BROADEN POST- 16 EDUCATION. WE WILL GIVE ALL 16-19 YEAR OLDS 
IN WORK THE EQUIVALENT OF AT LEAST TWO DAYS A WEEK EDUCATION OR 
TRAINING. COURSES WILL BE SELECTED BY BOTH THE EMPLOYER AND THE 
INDIVIDUAL AND WILL BE ACCREDITED AS PART OF OUR NEW 14-19 
SYSTEM. THOSE STUDYING FULL-TIME WILL STUDY UP TO THREE MAJOR 
AND TWO SUBSIDIARY SUBJECTS, ADDING WORK EXPERIENCE, PARENTING 
AND CITIZENSHIP TO BUILD A BACCALAUREATE-STYLE PROGRAMME.
 ¥ IMPROVE SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS PROVISION. WE WILL GIVE 
EVERY LEA A SEPARATE SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS SERVICE WITH ITS 
OWN BUDGET FOR WHICH SCHOOLS WILL BID FOR FUNDING. WE WILL 
REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO PREPARE, FOR EVERY CHILD WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 
WHO IS NOT CURRENTLY COVERED, AN INDICATIVE STATEMENT TO IDENTIFY 
NEEDS, SET TARGETS AND REPORT PROGRESS. THE SERVICE WILL BE 
MONITORED BY SPECIALISTS IN THE LOCAL INSPECTION TEAM AND IN HMI. 
¥ ENABLE EDUCATION FOR LIFE. WE WILL GIVE EVERY CITIZEN AN 
ENTITLEMENT TO A PERIOD OF RETRAINING OR EDUCATION AT A TIME OF THEIR 
CHOICE DURING THEIR ADULT LIVES, BASED ON DISTANCE LEARNING COSTS. 
WE WILL START BY GIVING THIS GUARANTEE TO THOSE GROUPS MOST IN 
NEED, INCLUDING THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED AND SINGLE PARENTS. 

OPENING THE DOORS TO HIGHER EDUCATION

BRITAIN'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM STILL PROVIDES EXCELLENT 
STANDARDS OF EDUCATION, BUT DOES SO FOR TOO FEW PEOPLE. LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS AIM TO INCREASE BOTH PARTICIPATION AND FLEXIBILITY IN 
STUDYING FOR DEGREES, BECAUSE NOT ALL STUDENTS WANT TO FOLLOW 
TRADITIONAL THREE-YEAR COURSES. WE WILL:
 ¥ INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION TO TWO 
MILLION BY THE YEAR 2000. AS WELL AS MORE YOUNG PEOPLE, WE 
WILL PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGE THE PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN, PEOPLE 
FROM MINORITY ETHNIC AND POORER BACKGROUNDS, AND PEOPLE WITH 
DISABILITIES.
 ¥ INCREASE FLEXIBILITY IN COURSES. WE WILL INTRODUCE A CREDIT-
BASED SYSTEM, ENABLING STUDENTS TO ACHIEVE A DIPLOMA AFTER THE 
EQUIVALENT OF TWO YEARS, WITH THE OPTION OF A FURTHER ONE OR TWO 
YEARS' STUDY LEADING TO A DEGREE. WE WILL MAKE FINANCIAL 
ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE FOR PART-TIME STUDY.
 ¥ OPEN UP NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDY. WE WILL DEVELOP 
DISTANCE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND EXTEND THE FRANCHISING OF 
HIGHER EDUCATION COURSES SO THAT COURSES CAN START AT LOCAL 
COLLEGES- HELPING PEOPLE WHO WISH OR NEED TO STUDY FROM 
HOME.
 ¥ FUND STUDENTS PROPERLY. WE WILL ABOLISH STUDENT LOANS AND 
RESTORE STUDENT ENTITLEMENT TO HOUSING BENEFIT AND INCOME 
SUPPORT. AS OUR PLANS FOR THE REFORM OF TAX AND BENEFITS ARE 
IMPLEMENTED, WE WILL ESTABLISH A STUDENT INCOME ENTITLEMENT AND 
A STUDENT ALLOWANCE TO WHICH ALL STUDENTS, BOTH FULL AND PART-TIME 
WILL BE ELIGIBLE. 
¥ GUARANTEE QUALITY. OUR NEW HIGHER EDUCATION STANDARDS COUNCIL 
WILL ENSURE THAT, AS NUMBERS RISE, QUALITY DOES NOT SUFFER. WE 
WILL ESTABLISH A PROPER CAREER STRUCTURE FOR RESEARCH FELLOWS AND 
SET UP A PAY REVIEW BODY FOR ACADEMIC AND NON-ACADEMIC STAFF TO 
HALT THE BRAIN DRAIN.
 ¥ INVEST IN RESEARCH WE WILL IMMEDIATELY INCREASE THE SCIENCE 
BUDGET TO O.35% OF GDP, AND RAISE IT STEADILY THEREAFTER. WE 
WILL ESTABLISH A NEW HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL. 

4. BRITAIN'S PEOPLE: HEALTHIER, SAFER AND 
BETTER HOUSED
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL INVEST IN LOCAL SERVICES TO ENABLE 
COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE. OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS OF ALL 
BACKGROUNDS AND MEANS CAN LIVE FREE OF THE FEAR OF SICKNESS, 
POVERTY AND CRIME.     
THE STEPS WE OUTLINE IN THIS PAPER ARE NECESSARY TO CREATE A FAIR, 
DEMOCRATIC AND PROSPEROUS SOCIETY, IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE 
TO MAKE THEIR VOICE HEARD AND DEVELOP THEIR TALENTS AND SKILLS TO 
THE FULL. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE CAN REALISE THEIR POTENTIAL BEST 
NOT AS ISOLATED INDIVIDUALS, BUT AS MEMBERS OF THRIVING AND 
RESPONSIBLE COMMUNITIES. WE WILL INVEST IN THE NETWORK OF 
COMMUNITY SERVICES-HEALTH, HOUSING, CRIME PREVENTION, SOCIAL 
SECURITY, ARTS AND SPORT-TO IMPROVE QUALITY, CHOICE AND 
OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE. 

GUARANTEEING HIGH-QUALITY HEALTH CARE

 LIBERAL DEMOCRATS REMAIN STEADFASTLY COMMITTED TO THE ORIGINAL 
AIMS OF THE NHS: TO ENABLE EVERYONE TO LIVE FREE OF THE FEAR OF 
ILLNESS, INJURY AND DISABILITY; TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FREE AT THE 
POINT OF DELIVERY AND REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY.
     THE GOVERNMENT'S "REFORMS" MEAN THAT PATIENTS ARE MADE TO 
FOLLOW THE MONEY; UNDER OUR PROPOSALS, MONEY WILL FOLLOW THE 
PATIENTS. WE ESPECIALLY OPPOSE THE TWO-TIER HEALTH SERVICE WHICH 
THE GOVERNMENT IS CREATING. OUR PRIORITIES ARE:
 ¥ A DECENT LEVEL OF HEALTH SERVICE FUNDING, INCLUDING AN ANNUAL 
REAL INCREASE TO MATCH THE COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND THE 
GROWING NUMBER OF ELDERLY PEOPLE. WE WILL START TO REPLACE THE 
UNDERFUNDING SUFFERED BY THE HEALTH SERVICE UNDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES, INVEST MORE IN RENOVATING AND CONSTRUCTING NEW 
HEALTH SERVICE BUILDINGS, AND INCREASE SPENDING IN THE PRIORITY 
AREAS LISTED BELOW. WE WILL ABOLISH TAX RELIEF FOR PRIVATE HEALTH 
INSURANCE, WHILST PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF EXISTING POLICY-HOLDERS.
 ¥ HEALTH PROMOTION-KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY, AND TREATING THE 
ROOT CAUSES OF ILL HEALTH. WE WILL PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR 
PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, HEALTH EDUCATION AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, 
INVEST IN SCREENING PROGRAMMES FOR THE PREVENTION OF DISEASE, 
TACKLE THE PROBLEMS OF DRUG ABUSE, BAN TOBACCO PROMOTION, 
REMOVE CHARGES FOR EYE TESTS AND DENTAL CHECKUPS, AND BOTH 
FREEZE AND EXTEND EXEMPTIONS FROM PRESCRIPTION CHARGES. WE 
WILL INCREASE RESOURCES FOR PRIMARY CARE. WE WILL RESTORE A 
COMPREHENSIVE DENTAL SCREENING SERVICE IN SCHOOLS AND IMPROVE 
THE DENTISTS' NHS CONTRACT. WE WILL REQUIRE ALL GOVERNMENT 
DEPARTMENTS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE IMPACT ON HEALTH OF THEIR 
DECISIONS -OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE IN AREAS SUCH AS INDUSTRIAL 
INVESTMENT, HOUSING, SOCIAL SECURITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION.
 ¥ REAL CHOICE IN HEALTH CARE. WE WILL INTRODUCE AN EFFECTIVE 
PATIENT'S CHARTER, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO HOSPITAL TREATMENT WITHIN A 
SPECIFIED TIME, A CHOICE OF GP, GUARANTEED ACCESS TO HEALTH 
RECORDS, AND A COMPREHENSIVE NO-FAULT COMPENSATION SCHEME. 
WE WILL REQUIRE HEALTH AUTHORITIES TO PUBLISH A CHARTER OF 
SERVICES, DEFINING BASIC ENTITLEMENTS, AND PROVIDE REDRESS WHERE 
THESE ARE NOT SATISFIED. WE WILL ESTABLISH A NEW NATIONAL 
INSPECTORATE FOR HEALTH TO GUARANTEE A QUALITY SERVICE. 
¥ BETTER HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN. WE WILL ENSURE ACCESS TO CLINICS 
PROVIDING HEALTH PROMOTION, COUNSELLING, FAMILY PLANNING AND 
SCREENING SERVICES, PARTICULARLY FOR CERVICAL AND BREAST CANCER, 
AND ADVICE ON MATERNITY AND CHILD CARE. WE WILL INCREASE THE 
AVAILABILITY BOTH OF TREATMENT BY WOMEN HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND 
OF HOME BIRTH.
 ¥ HIGH-QUALITY COMMUNITY CARE, AVAILABLE THROUGH VOLUNTARY, 
PRIVATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY SERVICES TO PEOPLE UNABLE TO CARE FOR 
THEMSELVES. WE WILL GIVE USERS CONTROL OVER THE OPTIONS FOR CARE 
AND PROVIDE SERVICES IN A WAY WHICH GUARANTEES INDIVIDUALS 
MAXIMUM INDEPENDENCE WHILE RETAINING EXISTING COMMUNITY 
LINKS. WE WILL PROVIDE BRIDGING FINANCE FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR 
THE TRANSITION TO THE NEW LEGISLATIVE ARRANGEMENTS ON COMMUNITY 
CARE. 
¥INVESTMENT IN NHS STAFF, INCLUDING SERVICE TRAINING, ESPECIALLY 
IN AREAS OF SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE AND CHANGING ROLES. WE WILL 
REFORM MEDICAL STAFFING AND TRAINING TO REPLACE THE CONSULTANT-LED 
HIERARCHY WITH TEAMS OF ACCREDITED SPECIALISTS.
 ¥ A HEALTH SERVICE FOR ALL. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE ASSESSMENT OF 
HEALTH-CARE NEEDS AND THE STRATEGIC PLANNING OF ALL SERVICES ARE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF DEMOCRATICALLY ACCOUNTABLE HEALTH AUTHORITIES. 
WE WILL REPLACE THE SO-CALLED "INTERNAL MARKET" WITH SERVICE 
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN AUTHORITIES AND HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH 
UNITS. WE WILL REPLACE GP FUNDHOLDING WITH A SYSTEM WHICH 
GUARANTEES GPS FREEDOM TO REFER PATIENTS OUTSIDE THE SERVICE 
AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED BY HEALTH AUTHORITIES. WE WILL CREATE A 
COMMON STRUCTURE OF LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF HOSPITALS AND 
COMMUNITY UNITS, ENDING THE ABILITY OF NHS TRUSTS TO DISPOSE OF 
THEIR CAPITAL ASSETS, TO SET THEIR OWN TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF 
SERVICE FOR STAFF, AND TO WITHDRAW FROM LOCAL PLANNING OF HEALTH 
SERVICES. 

PROVIDING GOOD HOUSING

DECENT, AFFORDABLE AND SAFE HOUSING IS VITAL TO PERSONAL 
HAPPINESS AND FAMILY LIFE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE HOME OWNERSHIP, 
BUT WE RECOGNISE THAT THE HOUSING MARKET HAS BEEN DISTORTED BY 
MORTGAGE TAX RELIEF, AND WE BELIEVE THAT CHOICE IN HOUSING MEANS 
PROVIDING MORE RENTED ACCOMMODATION IN BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
SECTORS. WE WILL: 
¥ INTRODUCE HOUSING COST RELIEF WEIGHTED TOWARDS THOSE MOST IN 
NEED AND AVAILABLE TO HOUSE BUYERS AND RENTERS. THIS WILL REPLACE 
MORTGAGE TAX RELIEF FOR FUTURE HOME BUYERS, WHICH OFTEN HELPS 
MOST THOSE WHO NEED IT LEAST, AND CAUSES ENORMOUS DISTORTIONS IN 
THE SAVINGS AND HOUSING MARKETS. PEOPLE HOLDING MORTGAGES WILL 
BE PROTECTED: THEY WILL HAVE THE CHOICE OF MOVING TO HOUSING COST 
RELIEF OR CONTINUING TO RECEIVE MORTGAGE INTEREST TAX RELIEF. 
¥ BOOST HOUSE BUILDING AND RENOVATION. WE WILL RELAX CONTROLS 
ON LOCAL AUTHORITY CAPITAL RECEIPTS, ESPECIALLY FOR NEW COUNCIL 
BUILDING, FOR HOUSES BUILT IN COOPERATION WITH HOUSING 
ASSOCIATIONS, AND FOR RENOVATION AND REPAIR WORK. WE RECOGNISE 
THAT THE URGENT NEED FOR HOMES CAN ONLY BE MET BY  MOBILISING 
BOTH PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND PUBLIC SPENDING. WE WILL THEREFORE 
CREATE A NEW PARTNERSHIP HOUSING SECTOR TO ENSURE HIGH-QUALITY 
AFFORDABLE RENTED HOUSING.
 . IMPROVE TENANTS' RIGHTS TO BETTER STANDARDS OF REPAIR AND 
MAINTENANCE IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE 
COUNCILS TO CREATE MORE TENANTS' COOPERATIVES. WE WILL RETAIN THE 
RIGHT OF COUNCIL TENANTS TO OPT FOR A CHANGE OF LANDLORD, BUT ONLY 
AFTER A FAIR BALLOT. 
¥ TAKE URGENT ACTION ON HOMELESSNESS. WE WILL PAY INCOME 
SUPPORT TO CLAIMANTS IN ADVANCE AND ASSIST WITH INITIAL DEPOSITS, 
EXTEND THE DUTY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PROVIDE ACCOMMODATION 
FOR 16-18 YEAR OLDS, AND ENCOURAGE COUNCILS TO ASSIST EACH OTHER 
WITH HOUSING NEEDS. WE WILL FUND THE PROVISION OF SHORT-TERM 
RENTED HOUSING TO REDUCE THE USE OF BED AND BREAKFAST 
ACCOMMODATION, WE WILL LEGISLATE TO BRING INTO USE DWELLINGS LEFT 
EMPTY WITHOUT REASONABLE CAUSE FOR MORE THAN A YEAR 
¥ ADOPT NEW ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS FOR ALL BUILDINGS, 
COMMERCIAL AND DOMESTIC. WE WILL INTRODUCE A REQUIREMENT FOR 
ENERGY AUDITS ON ALL NEW BUILDINGS AS A PRECONDITION OF GRANTS 
FOR HOME INSULATION, SOLAR HEATING AND OTHER ENERGY-SAVING 
MEASURES. HOMES WHICH MEET THE NEW STANDARDS WILL BE EXEMPT 
FROM STAMP DUTY ON HOUSE PURCHASE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE SHARED 
COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SCHEMES, AND ENCOURAGE THOSE 
PLANNING NEW HOUSES TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SCOPE FOR PASSIVE 
SOLAR HEATING. 

 HOME ENERGY EFFICIENCY DISCOUNT

SAVING ENERGY IN THE HOME MAKES GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL SENSE, 
AND WILL SAVE MONEY ON ELECTRICITY AND GAS BILLS. WE WILL MAKE 
HOUSES WHICH MEET HIGH STANDARDS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY EXEMPT 
FROM THE FIRST ~1,000 OF STAMP DUTY WHEN THEY ARE SOLD. THEIR 
ENERGY STANDARD WILL BE ASSESSED BY AN ENERGY AUDIT CARRIED OUT 
BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY UNIT.
     IF F A HOME DOES NOT MEET THE MINIMUM STANDARD, THE OWNER 
WILL BE ABLE TO CLAIM BACK ALL MONEY SPENT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR 
AFTER PURCHASE ON RAISING IT TO THAT LEVEL, THROUGH, FOR EXAMPLE, 
HOME INSULATION, UP TO THE AMOUNT OF STAMP DUTY THEY PAID WHEN 
THEY BOUGHT THE PROPERTY (UP TO THE MAXIMUM OF ~1,000). THIS 
WILL HELP TO CUT POLLUTION AND SAVE ENERGY AND GIVE A VALUABLE 
BOOST TO THE HOUSING MARKET. 

 PROTECTING THE COMMUNITY

OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS RECORDED CRIME HAS RISEN FASTER THAN AT 
ANY TIME IN OUR HISTORY. MEANWHILE, PRISON CONDITIONS HAVE 
DETERIORATED AND THE PUBLIC HAS LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL REVERSE THIS TREND BY: 
¥ CREATING SAFE AND SECURE COMMUNITIES. WE WILL GIVE LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES THE POWERS TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY 
CRIME PREVENTION PROGRAMMES, IMPROVE SERVICES TO VICTIMS, AND 
ENCOURAGE NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH AND SAFER CITY PROGRAMMES. WE 
WILL PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN 
HIGH-CRIME AREAS, PARTICULARLY TO PREVENT YOUNG PEOPLE DRIFTING 
INTO CRIME. 
¥ PUTTING MORE POLICE OFFICERS ON THE BEAT. WE WILL REDEPLOY 
POLICE RESOURCES IN ORDER TO INCREASE POLICE PRESENCE IN LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES AND ESTABLISH LOCAL NEIGHBOURHOOD OFFICES. WE WILL 
DECENTRALISE BUDGETARY CONTROL TO POLICE SUBDIVISIONS. WE WILL 
ENCOURAGE RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGNS AND TRAINING FOR PROMOTION TO 
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN AND ETHNIC MINORITY OFFICERS IN 
THE POLICE FORCE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER RANKS. MULTICULTURAL 
AND ANTI-RACISM TRAINING WILL ALSO INCREASE CONFIDENCE IN THE 
POLICE AMONG MINORITY ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. WE WILL SUPPORT THE 
CREATION BY THE POLICE OF NEW RACIAL ATTACKS SQUADS TO MONITOR 
AND COORDINATE ACTION AGAINST RACIALLY MOTIVATED ATTACKS. ¥ 
REFORMING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE WILL ESTABLISH A 
MINISTRY FOR JUSTICE, MERGING THE RELEVANT FUNCTIONS OF THE HOME 
OFFICE AND THE LORD CHANCELLOR'S DEPARTMENT. WE WILL CREATE THE 
POST OF PUBLIC DEFENDER, EQUIVALENT IN STATUS TO THE DPP AND 
RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING ALLEGED MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE. WE 
WILL EXTEND LEGAL AID, ENSURING THAT JUSTICE IS MORE WIDELY 
AVAILABLE. WE WILL ENCOURAGE "RESTORATIVE JUSTICE", IN WHICH 
MEDIATION BETWEEN VICTIMS AND OFFENDERS PROVIDES REPARATIONS 
FOR THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM CRIME. 
¥ RADICALLY REFORMING CONDITIONS INSIDE PRISONS, REDUCING 
OVERCROWDING, IMPROVING PRISON OFFICERS' MORALE AND PUNISHING 
OFFENDERS WHERE POSSIBLE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. WE WILL CREATE 
WOMEN'S UNITS IN PRISONS WHERE FEASIBLE. WE WILL EXTEND THE 
RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF PRISONERS ALONG THE LINES 
RECOMMENDED BY THE WOOLF REPORT, AND CREATE THE POST OF PRISON 
OMBUDSMAN. 
¥ AMEND THE PROVISION OF THE ASYLUM BILL. WE WILL INTRODUCE 
IMPROVED WELFARE AND LEGAL RIGHTS FOR GENUINE ASYLUM SEEKERS 
AND ESTABLISH SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS OF APPEAL. 

 A CITIZEN'S PENSION

AT PRESENT MANY PEOPLE DO NOT RECEIVE THE FULL BASIC STATE 
PENSION. IF THEY HAVE NOT PAID ENOUGH TAX BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT 
EARNED ENOUGH DURING THEIR WORKING LIVES, PEOPLE HAVE TO RELY ON 
MEANS TESTED BENEFITS WHEN THEY RETIRE. WOMEN IN PARTICULAR ARE 
BADLY AFFECTED, BECAUSE THEY TEND TO HAVE THE LOWEST PAID JOBS 
AND TO SPEND SEVERAL YEARS LOOKING AFTER CHILDREN.
     LIBERAL DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT A PENSION SHOULD BE A RIGHT FOR 
EVERYONE. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE BASIC STATE PENSION IS PAID AS 
OF RIGHT AND END MEANS TESTING FOR OUR POOREST SENIOR CITIZENS. 

 ENSURING A DECENT INCOME FOR ALL

THE TAX AND SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEMS ARE LONG OVERDUE FOR REFORM. 
OUR OBJECTIVES ARE TO SIMPLIFY INTEGRATE THE TWO SYSTEMS, TO 
MOUNT A DETERMINED ASSAULT ON POVERTY AND DEPENDENCE, AND TO 
PROTECT OUR CITIZENS FROM WANT. WE WILL WORK TOWARDS THE 
EVENTUAL CREATION OF A NEW "CITIZEN'S INCOME", PAYABLE TO ALL 
IRRESPECTIVE OF SEX OR STATUS. FOR PENSIONERS, THE CITIZEN'S 
INCOME WILL BE WELL ABOVE THE PRESENT PENSION, AND FOR EVERYONE 
ELSE IT WILL BE ABOUT ~12 . 80 A WEEK (AT PRESENT PRICES)     
UNPAID WORK WILL AT LAST BE RECOGNISED AS VALUABLE. WOMEN 
CARING IN THE HOME, FOR EXAMPLE, WILL RECEIVE AN INDEPENDENT 
INCOME FROM THE STATE FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE CITIZEN'S INCOME WILL 
BE BUTTRESSED BY A SINGLE BENEFIT FOR THOSE IN NEED, UNIFYING 
INCOME SUPPORT AND FAMILY CREDIT, WITH SUPPLEMENTS FOR PEOPLE 
WITH DISABILITIES AND FOR CHILD-CARE SUPPORT. THESE REFORMS WILL 
ENSURE THAT EVERY CITIZEN IS GUARANTEED A DECENT MINIMUM 
INCOME, WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE IN EMPLOYMENT OUR IMMEDIATE 
PRIORITIES, WHICH WILL ACT AS STEPS TOWARDS THE CITIZEN'S INCOME, 
INCLUDE: 
¥ IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS IN BENEFITS. WE WILL INCREASE CHILD 
BENEFIT BY £I PER WEEK FOR EACH CHILD. INCOME SUPPORT FOR UNDER-
25S WILL BE PAID AT THE FULL RATE, AN INCREASE OF £8 . 50 PER WEEK. 
WE WILL GIVE BACK TO 16 AND 17 YEAR OLDS THE RIGHT TO CLAIM 
INCOME SUPPORT. WE WILL END IMMEDIATELY THE MINIMUM POLL TAX 
LEVEL OF 20 PER CENT, PRIOR TO THE ABOLITION OF THE TAX ITSELF. WE 
WILL REFORM THE SOCIAL FUND, REMOVING ITS CASH LIMIT AND 
CONVERTING MOST LOANS INTO GRANTS. 
¥ INCREASING THE BASIC STATE PENSION IMMEDIATELY BY £5 A WEEK 
FOR SINGLE PENSIONERS, AND BY £8 A WEEK FOR MARRIED COUPLES. 
THIS HIGHER BASIC PENSION WILL BE PAID TO EVERY PENSIONER, 
REGARDLESS OF THEIR CONTRIBUTORY RECORD, TO END THE INDIGNITY OF 
MEANS TESTING. AFTER THE INITIAL INCREASE, WE WILL UPRATE THE BASIC 
PENSION EVERY YEAR IN LINE WITH AVERAGE EARNINGS. THIS WILL BE 
PAID FOR BY ABOLISHING SERPS, WHICH DOES NOT HELP THE POOREST 
PENSIONERS. PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BUILT UP SERPS ENTITLEMENTS 
WILL OF COURSE STILL RECEIVE THEIR SERPS PENSION. 
¥ PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF MEMBERS OF OCCUPATIONAL PENSION 
SCHEMES. WE WILL PROVIDE A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK PROTECTION, 
INCLUDING EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION ON OCCUPATIONAL PENSION 
TRUSTS. 
¥ CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE DISABILITY INCOME SCHEME TO GIVE 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES REAL FINANCIAL FREEDOM. WE WILL INCREASE 
INVALIDITY BENEFIT BY 15 PER CENT, EXTEND MOBILITY ALLOWANCE AND 
BASE PAYMENTS ON MEDICAL RECORDS RATHER THAN NATIONAL INSURANCE 
CONTRIBUTIONS. IN THE LONGER TERM WE AIM TO REIMBURSE 
INDIVIDUALS IN FULL FOR THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF THEIR DISABILITY. 
¥ CREATING A CARER'S BENEFIT FOR THE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO FORGO 
NORMAL EARNINGS TO LOOK AFTER ELDERLY OR DISABLED RELATIVES. WE 
WILL CONVERT INVALID CARE ALLOWANCE INTO A CARER'S BENEFIT, 
INCREASING ITS VALUE BY AN IMMEDIATE 15 PER CENT, INDEXING ITS 
FUTURE LEVEL TO EARNINGS AND ALTERING THE ENTITLEMENT RULES TO 
ENABLE CARERS TO COMBINE CARING WITH PART-TIME OR EVEN FULL-TIME 
JOBS AND TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WILL STILL BE ELIGIBLE EVEN IF THE 
CARING STARTS AFTER THE CARER REACHES PENSIONABLE AGE. 
¥ FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN BENEFITS. WE WILL, OVER THE LIFETIME OF 
A PARLIAMENT, PHASE OUT THE DIFFERENTIAL IN CHILD BENEFIT BETWEEN 
THE FIRST CHILD AND SUBSEQUENT CHILDREN; REINTRODUCE DEATH AND 
MATERNITY GRANTS; INCREASE THE FAMILY PREMIUM FOR INCOME 
SUPPORT AND FAMILY CREDIT, AND REFORM THE SYSTEM OF COLD-
WEATHER PAYMENTS. 
¥ UNIFYING INCOME TAX AND EMPLOYEES' NATIONAL INSURANCE 
CONTRIBUTIONS SO THAT THE TWO TAXES ARE COLLECTED AND ADMINISTERED 
TOGETHER AND PAID ON THE SAME INCOME, WHETHER FROM EARNINGS, 
INVESTMENTS, CAPITAL GAINS OR PERKS. 
¥ MAKING THE INVESTMENT NEEDED TO END THE RECESSION, USING THE 
MONEY BORROWED BY THE CONSERVATIVES TO PAY FOR THEIR PRE-
ELECTION TAX CUTS. WE WILL ALSO RAISE THE BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX 
BY ONE PENNY IN THE POUND TO PAY FOR THE IMPROVEMENTS ESSENTIAL 
TO EDUCATION. OUR NEW TAX RATES WILL BE AS FOLLOWS:

 -ABOUT 80 PER CENT OF TAX PAYERS WILL PAY 26 PER CENT INCOME 
TAX PLUS THE 9 PER CENT FROM NATIONAL INSURANCE (A COMBINED RATE 
OF 35 PER CENT).                                    -ON EARNINGS ABOVE 
£33,000, A COMBINED RATE OF 42 PER CENT WILL APPLY.
-ON EARNINGS ABOVE £50,000 A COMBINED RATE OF 50 PER CENT 
WILL BE PAID.
-PENSIONERS AND ORDINARY SAVERS WILL NOT PAY THE 9 PER CENT 
NATIONAL INSURANCE ELEMENT ON THEIR INCOMES. SPECIAL PROVISIONS 
WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT THOSE ON MODEST INCOMES MOST OF WHICH 
COMES FROM INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MADE 
REDUNDANT, DO NOT PAY THIS 9 PER CENT ON THEIR SAVINGS. 
                                  
 WIDENING HORIZONS: INVESTING IN THE ARTS

THE ARTS BENEFIT SOCIETY IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, ACCESS TO THE ARTS IS 
INTRINSIC TO A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE. SECOND, THE CULTURAL SECTOR-THE 
ARTS, CRAFTS, DESIGN, AND AUDIOVISUAL INDUSTRIES-MAKES AS GREAT 
A NET CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY AS DOES THE OIL INDUSTRY. WE 
WILL: 
¥ CREATE A NEW MINISTRY OF ARTS AND COMMUNICATIONS HEADED BY 
A MINISTER IN THE CABINET. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL RAISE INVESTMENT 
IN THE ARTS TO THE EC AVERAGE OVER FIVE YEARS. 
¥ REFORM AND DECENTRALISE ARTS FUNDING AND ORGANISATION. WE WILL 
DECENTRALISE MANY OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ARTS COUNCIL, 
INCREASING THE ROLES OF REGIONAL ARTS BOARDS AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. 
¥ STRENGTHEN LINKS BETWEEN THE ARTS AND EDUCATION. WE WILL 
ENHANCE PRACTICAL ARTS TEACHING AND LIBRARY PROVISION IN SCHOOLS 
AND EXTEND THE PROVISION OF ADULT EDUCATION FOR THE ARTS AND 
CRAFTS. WE WILL RESTORE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO 1980 
LEVELS. WE WILL ABOLISH MUSEUM CHARGES FOR SCHOOL 
  TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR BROADCASTING TO THE NEW MINISTRY. 
THE BBC IS A MAJOR PATRON OF THE ARTS, AND BROADCASTING ITSELF 
COMBINES A VARIETY OF ARTS AND CRAFTS. WE WILL REFORM RECENT 
LEGISLATION AFFECTING THE INDEPENDENT CHANNELS TO ENTRENCH THE 
INTERESTS OF QUALITY BROADCASTING A GUARANTEE POLITICAL 
INDEPENDENCE. THESE INTERESTS WILL ALSO BE REFLECTED IN THE 
IMPENDING REV THE BBC'S CHARTER, AND OUR PLANS FOR CABLE 
TELEVISION
¥ ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION WITHIN EUROPE-INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR 
COOPERATION IN THE INDUSTRY, IN PROTECTING AND ENHANCING OUR 
COMMON HERITAGE AND IN EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG 
ARTISTS OF ALL KINDS. 

ENCOURAGING A FIT, ACTIVE AND HEALTHY SOCIETY

SPORT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND HEALTH BENEFITS 
WHICH IT CAN BRING AND FOR ITS TO ENHANCE COMMUNITY IDENTITY. 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL: 
¥ CREATE A UK SPORTS COMMISSION TO PROVIDE A VOICE FOR 
PARTICIPANTS, SPECTATORS ADMINISTRATORS. STATE SPORTS COUNCILS WILL 
CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THEIR CORE FUNDS FROM GOVERNMENT THE 
COMMISSION WILL RAISE AND DISTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE 
PROMOTION OF PARTICIPATION AND EXCELLENCE. 
¥ ENCOURAGE SPORT ACROSS THE COMMUNITY. WE WILL ENCOURAGE 
SCHOOLS TO INVEST IN SPORTS FACILITIES AND OPEN THEM UP TO THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITY. WE WILL ESTABLISH COMMUNITY SPORTS PLANS OFFERING 
RELIEF TO SPORTS CLUBS THAT SHARE FACILITIES AND COACHING RESOURCES 
WITH LOCAL SCHOOLS. W ENCOURAGE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TRANSFORM 
FOOTBALL GROUNDS INTO MULTI-SPORT VENUES. 
¥ ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP, REVIEW THE 
ROLE OF THE FOUNDATION FOR ARTS AND SPORT AND RECONSIDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES' HASTY PROPOSAL FOR A NATIONAL LOTTERY. 
¥ MAINTAIN BRITAIN'S LEADING ROLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG ABUSE 
IN SPORT, ENSURING ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR TESTING PROGRAMMES AND 
EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS DIRECTED AT PARTICIPANTS. 
¥ ENHANCE SAFETY IN THE PROVISION OF SPORTS GROUNDS. WE WILL PUT 
THE SAFETY OF SPECTATORS FIRST IN LEGISLATION AND MAKE STANDARDS 
MANDATORY. WE WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SIZE OF GROUNDS ~ 
SETTING SAFETY STANDARDS. WE WILL RAISE REVENUE FOR INVESTMENT IN 
SAFETY BY INCREASING LEVIES FOOTBALL POOLS AND BETTING. WE WILL 
REQUIRE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO INCLUDE SPORTS SPECTATORS ON GROUND 
SAFETY COMMITTEES. 

GUARANTEEING EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES

A FORWARD-LOOKING SOCIETY PLACES AN EQUAL VALUE ON THE 
CONTRIBUTION OF ALL ITS CITIZENS-AND BENEFITS FROM THE 
PARTICIPATION OF ALL. YET IN TODAY'S BRITAIN MANY GROUPS OF 
INDIVIDUALS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY A SOCIETY 
WHICH FAILS TO RECOGNISE THEIR RIGHT TO EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL: 
¥ FIGHT DISCRIMINATION BY INCORPORATING THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION 
ON HUMAN RIGHTS INTO UK AND THEN EXTENDING IT INTO A FULL UK 
BILL OF RIGHTS. THIS WILL REINFORCE EXISTING PROTECTION IN B COURTS 
AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ON THE GROUNDS OF SEX, RACE, AGE, 
DISABILITY, RELIGION OR S~ ORIENTATION. WE WILL SET UP A 
COMMISSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE LEGAL 
ACTION IN CASES OF DISCRIMINATION OR OTHER BREACHES OF THE RIGHTS 
GUARANTEED IN THE CONVENTION. 
¥ STRENGTHEN THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN. WE WILL GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY 
FOR WORK OF EQUAL VALUE; REQUIRE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PRIVATE 
CONTRACTORS HOLDING PUBLIC CONTRACTS TO BE EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY 
EMPLOYERS AND IMPROVE CHILD-CARE SUPPORT AND FACILITIES. 
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION FOR ELECTIONS AND MODERNISING 
PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES WILL HELP TO END THE DISCRIMINATION 
AGAINST WOMEN ON ELECTED BODIES AND IN GOVERNMENT AT 
EUROPEAN, NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS. 
¥ EXTEND THE OPPORTUNITIES OF YOUNG PEOPLE. WE WILL ENTRENCH 
YOUNG PEOPLE'S RIGHTS REPRESENTATION ON ORGANISATIONS WHICH 
AFFECT THEIR LIVES AND WELL-BEING SUCH AS COLLEGE GOVERNING 
BODIES. WE WILL PLACE A STATUTORY OBLIGATION ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE Y SERVICE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 
VOLUNTARY SECTOR, AND WE WILL INVEST IN LEISURE AND RECREATION 
FACILITIES. YOUNG PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONFIDENTIAL 
MEDICAL ADVICE AND TREATMENT. 
¥ MAKE OLD AGE A TIME OF OPPORTUNITY. WE WILL INTRODUCE A 
FLEXIBLE "DECADE OF RETIREMENT" FOR AND WOMEN, IN WHICH PEOPLE 
MAY CHOOSE TO RETIRE AND TAKE A STATE PENSION AT ANY TIME BETWEEN 
60 AND 70 (THE VALUE OF THE PENSION INCREASING WITH THE AGE OF 
RETIREMENT). WE WILL INCREASE CHOICE FOR ELDERLY AND RETIRED 
PEOPLE BY ENCOURAGING OPENINGS IN VOLUNTARY AND PART-TIME 
WORK, WIDENING THE AVAILABILITY OF EDUCATION, THE ARTS AND 
RECREATIONAL FACILITIES. 
¥ PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ETHNIC MINORITIES. WE WILL REINFORCE 
LEGISLATION TO ENSURE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL, IN HOUSING, 
EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING, ESPECIALLY IN INNER-CITY 
AREAS. PR WILL GREATLY INCREASE THE POSSIBILITIES OF PARTICIPATION IN 
THE POLITICAL PROCESS. WE WILL REPEAL THE NATIONALITY ACT, REFORM 
IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION TO MAKE IT FREE FROM RACIAL DISCRIMINATION 
RESTORE THE RIGHT OF ENTRY TO BRITISH PASSPORT HOLDERS. WE WILL 
PUSH FOR THE EXTENSION OF EC DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION AND 
ENSURE THAT THE RIGHTS OF BLACK AND ASIAN BRITISH CITIZEN' ARE 
RESPECTED THROUGHOUT THE EC. WE WILL ENCOURAGE CHANGES TO THE 
EDUCATION SYSTEM WHICH POSITIVE VALUE ON A PLURALIST, DIVERSE AND 
MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 
¥ GUARANTEE EQUAL RIGHTS FOR GAY MEN AND LESBIANS THROUGH 
CHANGES TO CRIMINAL LAW,ANTI- DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION AND 
POLICE PRACTICES. WE WILL REPEAL SECTION 28 OF THE 1988 LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT ACT. WE WILL CREATE A COMMON AGE OF CONSENT 
REGARDLESS OF GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. 
¥ WORK WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS TO 
DRAW UP A CHARTER OF RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE WILL 
IMPLEMENT THE 1986 DISABLED PERSONS ACT IN FULL, GIVING PRIORITY 
TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVOCACY SCHEMES. 

5. BRITAIN'S PARTNERS: EUROPEAN PARTNERSHIP 
FOR THE NEW CENTURY

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE DECISIVE STEPS TOWARDS A FULLY 
INTEGRATED, FEDERAL AND DEMOCRATIC EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. WE 
BELIEVE THAT BY SHARING SOVEREIGNTY AND POOLING POWER, BRITAIN 
AND ITS PARTNERS WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO ACHIEVE COMMON GOALS FOR 
THE ECONOMY, THE ENVIRONMENT, SOCIETY AND SECURITY THAN BY 
ACTING ALONE. OUR AIM IS TO CREATE A CITIZENS' EUROPE IN WHICH 
POWER LIES AS CLOSE TO THE CITIZEN AS POSSIBLE. 

MAKING BRITAIN'S EUROPEAN PRESIDENCY WORK

VERY FEW OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE SET OUT IN THE PRECEDING 
SECTIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL UNLESS BRITAIN IS PREPARED TO WORK IN 
PARTNERSHIP WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. FOLLOWING MAASTRICHT, YET 
AGAIN BRITAIN RISKS BEING LEFT BEHIND WHILE THE REST OF EUROPE 
MOVES ON. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WANT BRITAIN TO PLAY A FULL ROLE IN 
CREATING A DYNAMIC AND DEMOCRATIC EUROPE. WE WILL USE BRITAIN'S 
SIX-MONTH TENURE OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COMMUNITY'S COUNCIL 
OF MINISTERS TO MAKE A START ON THE REAL TASKS THAT LIE AHEAD: 
BUILDING A PROSPEROUS AND INTEGRATED ECONOMY; CORRECTING THE 
DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT, MAKING EUROPE WORK FOR ITS CITIZENS, NOT ITS 
INSTITUTIONS: WIDENING THE COMMUNITY'S MEMBERSHIP; AND HELPING 
TO CREATE A PEACEFUL AND STABLE NEW WORLD ORDER.     
WE CANNOT EXPECT BRITAIN TO INFLUENCE THE DIRECTION THE 
COMMUNITY TAKES IN THE NEXT DECADE UNLESS IT IS A FULL AND 
ENTHUSIASTIC MEMBER.   
  OUR VISION OF THE NEW EUROPE IS OF A FEDERAL COMMUNITY, WHERE 
POWER IS EXERCISED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH GOOD 
GOVERNMENT. FOR US, FEDERALISM MEANS DECENTRALISATION: PASSING 
POWERS DOWN MORE THAN PASSING THEM UP. THE CREATION OF 
SCOTTISH, WELSH AND ENGLISH REGIONAL PARLIAMENTS THEREFORE GOES 
HAND IN HAND WITH THE PROMOTION OF MORE EUROPEAN COOPERATION 
AND PARTNERSHIP, ENSURING ACCESS TO POWER FOR INDIVIDUALS AND 
THEIR COMMUNITIES RIGHT ACROSS EUROPE. 

BUILDING A CITIZENS' EUROPE

JANUARY 1993 WILL BRING THE SINGLE MARKET. ECONOMIC AND 
MONETARY UNION WILL FOLLOW BY THE END OF THE DECADE. YET THE 
COMMUNITY IS STILL TOO MUCH AN ORGANISATION FOR BUSINESSMEN 
AND BUREAUCRATS INSTEAD OF CITIZENS AND COMMUNITIES. WE WANT TO 
MOULD EUROPE'S FUTURE IN THE INTERESTS OF EUROPE'S PEOPLE. OUR 
PRIORITIES ARE: 
¥ ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
AN INDEPENDENT EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK AND A SINGLE EUROPEAN 
CURRENCY. WE WILL RENOUNCE THE CONSERVATIVES' "OPT-OUT" CLAUSE 
AND ACCEPT THE TIMETABLE FOR EMU. 
¥ COOPERATION IN RESEARCH AND INNOVATION. WE WILL ENCOURAGE 
FURTHER COLLABORATION WITHIN THE EC ON MAJOR SCIENTIFIC PROJECTS 
AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND 
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE INNOVATIONS. 
¥ ACTION ON THE ENVIRONMENT. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS CANNOT BE 
SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED UNLESS ACTION IS TAKEN ACROSS THE 
COMMUNITY. THE PROPOSED EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY MUST 
BE ESTABLISHED, A EUROPEAN ENERGY POLICY DRAWN UP AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL SUBSIDIES AND PENALTIES APPLIED COMMUNITY-WIDE. 
¥ AN ACTIVE REGIONAL AND SOCIAL POLICY. THE SINGLE MARKET AND 
ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION WILL EXPOSE REGIONS AND FIRMS TO 
GREATER COMPETITION. THIS WILL BE BENEFICIAL IN THE LONG RUN, BUT 
THE EC MUST ASSIST IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. WE WILL RENOUNCE 
BRITAIN'S SOCIAL CHAPTER "OPT-OUT" AND ARGUE FOR A MORE FLEXIBLE 
FRAMEWORK OF SOCIAL POLICY ACROSS THE COMMUNITY. THE EC 
SHOULD SET DOWN MINIMUM STANDARDS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY AND 
EMPLOYEE RIGHTS, LEAVING NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND ENTERPRISES TO 
DECIDE HOW TO MEET THEM, SUBJECT ULTIMATELY TO THE JUDGEMENT OF 
THE COURTS. 
¥ FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY. WE 
WILL EASE THE TRANSITION FROM THE PRESENT WASTEFUL AND INEFFICIENT 
PRICE SUPPORT MECHANISM TO MARKET PRICES AND DIRECT SUPPORT FOR 
FARMERS' INCOMES TO ACHIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL GOALS, TO 
BE FUNDED BY SAVINGS MADE FROM THE PRESENT INTERVENTION 
PAYMENT SYSTEM. 

CREATING A NEW DEMOCRACY IN EUROPE

THE COMMUNITYS STRUCTURE GIVES FAR TOO MUCH WEIGHT TO THE 
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, 
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN. FURTHER MOVES 
TO EUROPEAN UNION, AND ENLARGEMENT, MUST DEPEND ON THE 
INSTITUTIONS OF THE EC BECOMING TRULY DEMOCRATIC. WE WILL: 
¥ SET OUT THE RIGHTS OF THE EUROPEAN CITIZEN. WE WILL WORK FOR A 
CLEAR DEFINITION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE EUROPEAN CITIZEN, AND INSIST 
THAT THESE ARE COMMON TO ALL COMMUNITY NATIONALS. THIS MUST 
INCLUDE COMMON VOTING RIGHTS AT LOCAL, NATIONAL AND EUROPEAN 
LEVELS. 
¥ INCREASE THE DEMOCRATIC POWERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. 
WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE PARLIAMENT BECOMES AN EFFECTIVE PARTNER 
WITH THE COUNCIL IN LAW-MAKING, EXERCISING IN FULL THE POWER OF 
"CO DECISION". 
  INTRODUCE FAIR VOTES FOR THE 1994 BRITISH ELECTIONS TO THE 
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. THE BRITISH CITIZEN MUST NO LONGER BE 
DENIED THE FAIR VOTING SYSTEMS ENJOYED BY THE CITIZENS OF EVERY 
OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRY. 
¥ MAKE THE COMMISSION MORE ACCOUNTABLE. THE PARLIAMENT MUST 
HAVE THE POWER TO CONFIRM OR DENY THE COUNCIL'S NOMINEE AS 
PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION, AND THEN TO APPROVE OR NOT THE 
PRESIDENT'S CHOICE OF COMMISSIONERS-AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO SACK 
THEM IF NECESSARY. WE WELCOME THE PROVISIONS OF THE MAASTRICHT 
TREATY AS A FIRST STEP. 
¥ INCREASE DEMOCRACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE COUNCIL OF 
MINISTERS. WE WILL ARGUE TO EXTEND MAJORITY VOTING IN THE COUNCIL 
TO COVER ALL AREAS OF COMMUNITY POLICY OTHER THAN CONSTITUTIONAL 
AND CRUCIAL SECURITY MATTERS. WHEN PASSING LAWS, THE COUNCIL 
SHOULD MEET IN PUBLIC. 
¥ IMPROVE NATIONAL SCRUTINY OF MINISTERS ACTIONS IN EUROPE. WE 
WILL CREATE A NEW EUROPE COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 
AND GIVE OUR REFORMED HOUSE OF LORDS A SPECIAL ROLE IN 
SCRUTINISING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY. 
¥ PREPARE FOR COMMUNITY ENLARGEMENT, WELCOMING EFTA 
MEMBERS AND, WHEN THEY ARE READY, THE NEW DEMOCRACIES OF 
CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. A COMMUNITY WITH MORE MEMBERS 
REQUIRES REFORMED AND DYNAMIC INSTITUTIONS. FURTHER MOVES TO 
EUROPEAN UNION, AND ENLARGEMENT, MUST DEPEND ON THE 
INSTITUTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY BECOMING TRULY 
DEMOCRATIC. 

SHARING SECURITY; WORKING FOR PEACE

THE GULF WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH HAVE SHOWN THE CRUCIAL NEED FOR 
STRONGER AND MORE EFFECTIVE WORLD INSTITUTIONS CAPABLE OF 
UPHOLDING INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ENFORCING RESPECT FOR HUMAN 
RIGHTS. BRITAIN MUST ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITY PLAYS A PIVOTAL 
ROLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW SECURITY ORDER IN EUROPE, 
FOLLOWING THE DEMOCRATISATION OF EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE. 
NEW INITIATIVES FOR DISARMAMENT AND FOR SHARING SECURITY 
BURDENS WILL ENABLE FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN LEVELS OF ARMAMENTS TO 
BE MADE WITHOUT ENDANGERING SECURITY. ON THE GLOBAL STAGE, A 
STRONGER UNITED NATIONS WILL BE NEEDED TO UNDERPIN COOPERATION 
IN TACKLING THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS. WE WILL: 
¥ DEVELOP COMMON EUROPEAN COMMUNITY FOREIGN AND SECURITY 
POLICIES. THIS WILL INCLUDE A COMMON APPROACH TO DEFENCE 
PROCUREMENT AND THE GRADUAL INTEGRATION OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS' 
ARMED FORCES UNDER A JOINT MILITARY COMMAND. THE BURDEN OF 
COLLECTIVE SECURITY IN WESTERN EUROPE SHOULD BE SHARED MORE 
EQUALLY; WE WILL PRESS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ALL NATIONS TO THE 
COSTS OF JOINT FORCES SUCH AS NATO'S PROPOSED RAPID REACTION 
FORCE-OF WHICH BRITAIN WILL PROVIDE ALMOST HALF. 
¥ PROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND REFORM IN EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE 
BY COORDINATING GENEROUS ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES 
INTRODUCING DEMOCRACY, GUARANTEEING HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
REFORMING THEIR ECONOMIES. ¥ ASSIST THE PEACEFUL EVOLUTION OF THE 
COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES, THE FORMER USSR. WE 
WILL HELP NOT JUST WITH FOOD AND FINANCIAL AID AND TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE, BUT ALSO WITH THE PROVISION OF MILITARY RESOURCES TO 
SHIFT FOOD AND SUPPLIES, AND WITH SCIENTIFIC ASSISTANCE TO 
DISMANTLE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
¥ DEVELOP A PAN-EUROPEAN SECURITY FRAMEWORK. WE WILL 
ENCOURAGE THE CONFERENCE ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE 
TO DEVELOP MONITORING, VERIFICATION AND MEDIATION DUTIES WITHIN 
THE CONTINENT. WE WILL PRESS FOR NATO TO GUARANTEE THE BORDERS 
OF POLAND, CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY AND TO ENTER INTO TALKS 
WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION FOR SIMILAR GUARANTEES. 
¥ INSTIGATE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF UK DEFENCE POLICY WHICH 
WILL BE DICTATED BY A RIGOROUS ANALYSIS OF DEFENCE NEEDS RATHER 
THAN BY FIXED MONETARY TARGETS. THE REVIEW WILL COVER THE 
CONTINUING NEED FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO COLLECTIVE SECURITY, THE VALUE 
OF BRITAIN'S REMAINING EXTRA EUROPEAN COMMITMENTS, AND THE 
POTENTIAL FOR INCREASING OUR CONTRIBUTION TO UN PEACEKEEPING 
MISSIONS. GIVEN THE PRESENT HOPEFUL INTERNATIONAL SITUATION, WE 
BELIEVE THAT FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN LEVELS OF ARMAMENTS WILL BE ABLE 
TO BE MADE WITHOUT IN ANY WAY ENDANGERING SECURITY. SINCE THE 
REVIEW WILL SET OUT THE FRAMEWORK FOR DEFENCE POLICY FOR YEARS TO 
COME, WE WILL HALT ANY DEFENCE CUT, AND ANY ORDER FOR A NEW 
WEAPONS SYSTEM, WHICH MIGHT PREJUDICE ITS OUTCOME. 
¥ ESTABLISH AN ARMS CONVERSION AGENCY TO HELP ARMS 
MANUFACTURERS TO DIVERSIFY AND CONVERT OUT OF THE DEFENCE FIELD, 
FUNDED BY SAVINGS MADE IN THE DEFENCE BUDGET. OUR PROPOSED 
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WILL ALSO PROVIDE HELP TO AREAS 
PARTICULARLY AFFECTED. WE WILL REDUCE SPENDING ON MILITARY 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SHIFT THE RESOURCES SAVED INTO THE 
CIVILIAN SECTOR. 
¥ MAINTAIN A MINIMUM NUCLEAR DETERRENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE UK 
NEEDS TO RETAIN ITS INDEPENDENT NUCLEAR DETERRENT, BUT THAT THE 
ESCALATION OF FIREPOWER REPRESENTED BY THE SCALE OF THE TRIDENT 
REPLACEMENT FOR POLARIS IS UNNECESSARY AND UNHELPFUL. WE WILL 
ENSURE THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WARHEADS ON THE FOUR-BOAT 
TRIDENT SYSTEM IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THAT CURRENTLY DEPLOYED 
ON THE POLARIS SYSTEM, AND OUR DEFENCE REVIEW WILL CONSIDER 
WHETHER WE CAN REDUCE THIS FURTHER WITHOUT THREATENING SECURITY. 
OUR REVIEW WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE POSSIBILITIES OF FUTURE EUROPEAN 
COOPERATION IN THE PROVISION OF A DETERRENT FORCE. WE REJECT THE 
GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED REPLACEMENT OF BRITISH FREE-FALL NUCLEAR 
BOMBS WITH AIR-TO-SURFACE MISSILES. 
¥ PROPOSE NEW DISARMAMENT INITIATIVES COVERING ALL CATEGORIES OF 
CONVENTIONAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS THESE WILL AIM TO ELIMINATE 
NON-STRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS FROM EUROPE, AND TO REDUCE THE 
STRATEGIC WEAPONS POSSESSED BY THE US, THE FORMER SOVIET 
UNION, BRITAIN, FRANCE AND CHINA- A VITAL STEP TOWARDS THE DAY 
WHEN INDIVIDUAL NATIONS' POSSESSION OF NUCLEAR DETERRENTS CEASES 
TO BE NECESSARY. 
¥ ACT AGAINST THE ARMS TRADE. TOGETHER WITH OUR COMMUNITY 
PARTNERS, WE WILL ESTABLISH A REGISTER OF ALL INTERNATIONAL ARMS 
SALES, EVENTUALLY TO BECOME A UN REGISTER. WE WILL PLACE A TOTAL 
EMBARGO ON ARMS SALES TO REGIMES WHICH VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS, 
AND WORK FOR FURTHER GLOBAL AGREEMENTS AMONG SUPPLIERS TO 
CONTROL ARMS SALES AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER. WE WILL CLOSE THE 
DEFENCE EXPORT SERVICES ORGANISATION AND ENSURE THAT OVERSEAS 
AID IS NOT LINKED IN ANY WAY TO ARMS PURCHASES. 
¥ MAKE THE UNITED NATIONS MORE EFFECTIVE. THE UN SECURITY 
COUNCIL SHOULD TAKE A PROACTIVE ROLE IN PEACE-KEEPING BEFORE 
CONFRONTATION DEVELOPS INTO CONFLICT. WE WILL WORK WITH OUR 
COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR 
MAINTAINING PEACE AND SECURITY. THE UN MILITARY STAFF COMMITTEE 
SHOULD BE REINSTATED AND A PERMANENT PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
ESTABLISHED, WITH MEMBER STATES CONTRIBUTING CONTINGENTS ON AN 
ANNUAL BASIS. BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO ASSIGN BRITISH FORCES TO THIS 
AND TO EUROPEAN POLICING AND DISASTER ROLES (ON TOP OF THEIR 
PRESENT COMMITMENTS)~ MORE GENERAL PURPOSE INFANTRY BATTALIONS 
WILL BE REQUIRED THAN THE NUMBER CURRENTLY PLANNED BY THE 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT. 

DEVELOPING GLOBAL PROSPERITY

A SECURE, DEMOCRATIC AND PEACEFUL WORLD CAN NEVER BE CREATED 
WHILE SO MUCH OF THE GLOBE REMAINS SO DESPERATELY POOR. BRITAIN 
MUST PLAY ITS PART IN DEVELOPING PROSPERITY, PROTECTING THE WORLD 
ENVIRONMENT, ERADICATING POVERTY, FAMINE AND DISEASE, AND 
PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. THIS WILL 
INCLUDE: 
¥ INCREASING OVERSEAS AID TO REACH THE UN TARGET OF 0.7 PER CENT 
OF GNP OVER FIVE YEARS. WE WILL INCREASE AID ESPECIALLY TO 
DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES CARRYING OUT POLICIES WHICH BENEFIT THE 
POOREST, ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE AND RESPECT HUMAN 
RIGHTS. WE WILL RAISE THE PROPORTION OF AID GIVEN AS GRANTS INSTEAD 
OF LOANS AND PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON SUPPORTING SMALL-SCALE, 
COMMUNITY-BASED, LABOUR-INTENSIVE PROJECTS. WE WILL PROMOTE 
CLOSER EUROPEAN COOPERATION, TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF NATIONAL 
AND COMMUNITY AID, AND AVOID WASTEFUL DUPLICATION. WE WILL 
REJOIN UNESCO. 
¥ ENDING THE COMMERCIALISATION OF AID WHICH THE CURRENT 
GOVERNMENT HAS PRACTISED AND WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES ITS 
VALUE TO THE WORLD'S POOREST. WE WILL REDUCE THE PROPORTION OF 
UK AID TIED TO THE PURCHASE OF UK GOODS AND SERVICES AND 
ENSURE THAT HELP TO BRITISH EXPORTS IS SOLELY A FUNCTION OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY, RATHER THAN THE ODA. 
¥ ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THIS 
INCLUDES THE TRANSFER OF APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY, THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY, SUSTAINABLE USE POLICIES 
FOR THE TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS AND PROJECTS TO PREVENT 
DESERTIFICATION, AND THE PROMOTION OF ENERGY CONSERVATION AND 
RENEWABLE ENERGY SCHEMES. WE WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL HELP TO 
DEVELOP METHODS OF RESOURCE ACCOUNTING AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION AND ENSURE THAT MEASURES OF SUSTAINABILITY ARE 
INCORPORATED IN DECISIONS ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND 
PROGRAMMES. 
¥ URGENT ACTION TO TACKLE THE GROWTH IN THE WORLD'S POPULATION. 
HAVING DOUBLED IN THE PAST 50 YEARS TO FIVE BILLION, THE WORLD'S 
POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY A FURTHER ONE BILLION IN THE 
1990S ALONE. WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO SUPPORT FOR FAMILY-
PLANNING PROGRAMMES, EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR WOMEN, AND BASIC PROVISION FOR OLD AGE. 
 REFORM OF THE WORLD TRADING AND FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. WE SEE THE 
SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF THE URUGUAY ROUND OF THE GATT WORLD 
TRADE TALKS AS AN URGENT PRIORITY. GLOBAL PROSPERITY ALSO REQUIRES 
THE REVERSAL OF THE NET FLOW OF RESOURCES FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH. 
WE WILL PRESS THE EC TO COORDINATE INTERNATIONAL ACTION TO RESOLVE 
THE DEBT CRISIS, INCLUDING REDUCING GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT 
DEBT, INTRODUCING REGULATORY AND TAX REGIMES TO ENCOURAGE 
COMMERCIAL BANKS TO REDUCE OR WRITE OFF DEBT, EXTENDING 
ELIGIBILITY TO IMF AND WORLD BANK LOANS, AND ENCOURAGING, 
WHERE APPROPRIATE, DEBT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND DEBT FOR 
ENVIRONMENT SWAPS. WE WILL PRESS FOR THE PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION 
OF ALL TARIFF AND NON-TARIFF TRADE BARRIERS, AND IN PARTICULAR THE 
REMOVAL OF UNFAIR TRADING BARRIERS AGAINST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. 

6. BRITAIN'S DEMOCRACY: ELECTORAL AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS, ALONE IN BRITISH POLITICS, RECOGNISE THAT 
UNLESS WE CHANGE BRITAIN'S SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, WE CANNOT 
CHANGE BRITAIN'S FUTURE. WITHOUT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM, WE WILL 
NOT ACHIEVE OUR OTHER OBJECTIVES. WE BELIEVE IN CITIZENSHIP, NOT 
SUBJECTHOOD-IN THE ABILITY OF ALL INDIVIDUALS TO EXERCISE POWER 
OVER THE INSTITUTIONS THAT GOVERN THEIR LIVES. THE CREATION OF A 
MODERNISED DEMOCRACY THEREFORE LIES AT THE HEART OF ALL OUR 
PROPOSALS. WE RECOGNISE TOO THAT BRITAIN'S SUCCESS IN THE NEXT 
CENTURY WILL DEPEND NOT JUST ON CHANGING WHAT WE DO, BUT IN 
CHANGING THE WAY IN WHICH WE DO IT. HOWEVER WORTHY ITS 
INTENTIONS, AND HOWEVER ABLE ITS PERSONNEL, NO GOVERNMENT WILL 
BE ABLE TO PUT BRITAIN RIGHT UNLESS AND UNTIL IT HAS MODERNISED OUR 
CONSTITUTION. 

FAIR VOTING FOR AN EFFECTIVE PARLIAMENT

OUR CURRENT "WINNER TAKES ALL" SYSTEM OF VOTING HAS MANY FAULTS. 
IT IS UNFAIR, UNSTABLE AND DIVISIVE. GOVERNMENT BY MINORITY IS 
USUALLY BAD GOVERNMENT: IN NO TRULY DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY COULD A 
DISASTER LIKE THE POLL TAX HAVE BEEN PUSHED THROUGH IN DEFIANCE OF 
PUBLIC OPINION, WASTING BILLIONS OF POUNDS AND CAUSING MISERY 
TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. OUR TOP PRIORITY IS THEREFORE THE 
INTRODUCTION OF FAIR VOTES FOR ALL ELECTIONS AT ALL LEVELS OF 
GOVERNMENT. 
~     FAIR VOTES WILL MAKE EVERY ELECTOR'S VOTE COUNT. IT WILL 
INCREASE CITIZEN' CONTROL OVER THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES BY 
ABOLISHING SAFE SEATS. IT WILL ERADICATE THE POWER OF THE EXTREMIST 
MINORITY IN POLITICAL PARTIES. IT WILL LEAD TO A BETTER CHOICE OF 
CANDIDATES AND ENSURE THAT MORE WOMEN AND CANDIDATES FROM 
MINORITY ETHNIC COMMUNITIES ARE ELECTED. ABOVE ALL, IT WILL REDUCE 
TIT-FOR-TAT POLITICS AND INTRODUCE MUCH GREATER STABILITY INTO 
GOVERNMENT, ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES ALIKE TO PLAN 
FOR THEIR FUTURE WITH CONFIDENCE. WE WILL: 
¥ BRING IN FAIR VOTES. WE WILL INTRODUCE PROPORTIONAL 
REPRESENTATION FOR ALL ELECTIONS AT LOCAL, NATIONAL AND EUROPEAN 
LEVELS. WE PROPOSE THE SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE, BY WHICH 
ELECTORS CAST THEIR VOTES IN MULTI-MEMBER CONSTITUENCIES BASED ON 
NATURAL COMMUNITIES. 
¥ INTRODUCE FIXED-TERM PARLIAMENTS OF FOUR YEARS WITH A KNOWN 
DATE FOR THE NEXT ELECTION , SUBJECT TO AN EARLIER ELECTION ONLY IF THE 
GOVERNMENT LOSES A SPECIAL "EXPLICIT" VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE. 
¥ REFORM THE HOUSE OF LORDS. WE WILL MAINTAIN A SECOND 
CHAMBER AS A SENATE, PRIMARILY ELECTED BY THE CITIZENS OF THE 
NATIONS AND REGIONS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. IT WILL HAVE POWER 
TO DELAY ALL LEGISLATION OTHER THAN MONEY BILLS FOR UP TO TWO 
YEARS. 
¥IMPROVE THE WAY PARLIAMENT WORKS. WE WILL GIVE MPS GREATER 
INFLUENCE OVER THE EXECUTIVE BY BOOSTING THE POWERS OF SELECT 
COMMITTEES, IMPROVING STAFF BACKUP FOR BACKBENCHERS AND 
INCREASING FINANCIAL AND CIVIL SERVICE SUPPORT FOR OPPOSITION 
PARTIES. WE WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATION BY 
ESTABLISHING PRE-LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES AND BETTER SCRUTINY OF 
DELEGATED LEGISLATION. WE WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DEBATES BY 
ALLOCATING TIME FOR BUSINESS MORE FAIRLY, TIMETABLING COMMITTEE 
SESSIONS OF BILLS AND ENDING PARLIAMENT'S LATE-NIGHT SITTINGS. 

 BRINGING POWER TO THE PEOPLE

OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS FAR TOO CENTRALISED, AND FAILS TO 
MAKE EFFECTIVE USE OF THE TALENTS AND SKILLS AVAILABLE ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT POLITICAL POWER IS BEST EXERCISED AT THE 
MOST LOCAL LEVEL POSSIBLE, CONSISTENT WITH GOOD GOVERNMENT. WE 
WILL: 
 INTRODUCE HOME RULE FOR SCOTLAND, WITH THE IMMEDIATE CREATION 
OF AN ELECTED SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT. 
¥ INTRODUCE HOME RULE FOR WALES, WITH THE IMMEDIATE CREATION OF 
AN ELECTED WELSH SENEDD. 
¥ REFORM AND STRENGTHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT, REMOVING 
UNNECESSARY TIERS, RESTORING COUNCILS' INDEPENDENCE AND 
ENSURING THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE THROUGH A FAIR VOTING 
SYSTEM. 
¥ CREATE THE FRAMEWORK FOR REGIONAL GOVERNMENT IN ENGLAND. WE 
WILL ENABLE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FULLY DEMOCRATIC REGIONAL 
GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT ENGLAND. WE WILL SET UP A STRATEGIC 
AUTHORITY FOR LONDON AS A PRIORITY. PRECEDING THE NEW REGIONAL 
GOVERNMENTS, WE WILL ESTABLISH REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES 
THROUGHOUT ENGLAND, HELPING TO BOOST ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
AND PROSPERITY.
 ¥ DECENTRALISE POWER TO THE NEW NATIONAL AND REGIONAL 
GOVERNMENTS. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, HOUSING, HEALTH, SOCIAL 
SERVICES, ROADS AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT, EDUCATION AND PLANNING ARE 
FUNCTIONS WHICH SHOULD BE DEVOLVED FROM WHITEHALL AND BROUGHT 
NEARER THE PEOPLE THEY MOST AFFECT. 

 CONSULTING LOCAL CITIZENS

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WANT LOCAL COUNCILS TO BE AS RESPONSIVE AND 
ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR LOCAL CITIZENS AS POSSIBLE. WE WILL INTRODUCE 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AN INITIATIVE PIONEERED BY LIBERAL DEMOCRAT-
RUN COUNCILS SUCH AS SOUTH SOMERSET AND RICHMOND.
     WE WILL REQUIRE EVERY COUNCIL TO CONDUCT AN ANNUAL SURVEY OF 
ALL ITS RESIDENTS TO GAUGE THEIR VIEWS ON THE QUALITY OF LOCAL 
SERVICES. A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY, COMPARED TO 
THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S FINDINGS, WILL BE PUBLISHED WITH THE ANNUAL 
DEMAND FOR THE LOCAL INCOME TAX, SO THAT EVERY RESIDENT IS ABLE TO 
TELL WHAT THEIR COUNCIL IS ACHIEVING WITH THE MONEY THEY PAY. 

 STRENGTHENING LOCAL GOVERNMENT

THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
FINANCE-MOST NOTABLY THROUGH THE POLL TAX FIASCO-HAS BEEN TO 
DESTROY THE INDEPENDENCE OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES BY REDUCING THEIR 
POWERS TO RAISE AND SPEND REVENUE. THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 
APPROACH IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE: WE AIM TO TAKE POWER AWAY 
FROM WESTMINSTER AND WHITEHALL, GIVING NEW POWERS TO 
STRONGER, MORE INDEPENDENT AND MORE DEMOCRATIC LOCAL 
COUNCILS-ELECTED BY FAIR VOTES. WE WILL: 
¥ ABOLISH THE POLL TAX, CANCEL PLANS FOR THE PROPOSED COUNCIL TAX 
AND INTRODUCE A LOCAL INCOME TAX, RELATED TO ABILITY TO PAY AND 
COLLECTED BY THE INLAND REVENUE. LOCAL INCOME TAX IS EASY TO 
UNDERSTAND, EASY TO ADMINISTER, AND FAIR. IT WORKS EFFECTIVELY IN 
MANY OTHER COUNTRIES.
 ¥ REPLACE THE UNIFORM BUSINESS RATE WITH SITE VALUE RATING-
LOCALLY ADMINISTERED AND BASED ON THE TAXATION OF LAND VALUES 
(WITH EXEMPTION FOR AGRICULTURAL LAND AND DOMESTIC PROPERTIES). 
THIS WILL CREATE INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE PROPERTY, RATHER THAN LEAVE 
IT UNDEVELOPED. ADMINISTRATION WILL BE EASIER AND LOCAL 
ACCOUNTABILITY WILL BE RESTORED. 
¥ REFORM AND STRENGTHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE WILL REFORM 
PRINCIPAL LOCAL COUNCILS INTO A UNITARY SYSTEM BASED ON NATURAL 
COMMUNITIES AND THE WISHES OF LOCAL PEOPLE. WE WILL GIVE THE 
NEW AUTHORITIES GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES-FOR EXAMPLE, OVER 
EDUCATION, HEALTH, AND PLANNING-AND FREEDOM TO ENSURE THE 
DELIVERY OF SERVICES IN WAYS THEY THINK BEST. LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
WILL BE GIVEN A "GENERAL POWER OF COMPETENCE", WHICH WILL ALLOW 
THEM TO CARRY OUT ANY BENEFICIAL LOCAL ACTION WHICH NEITHER 
DUPLICATES THE WORK OF OTHER PUBLIC BODIES NOR BREAKS THE LAW.

-¥ BRING LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEARER TO THE PEOPLE, BY ENABLING THE 
FORMATION OF A FULL NETWORK OF COMMUNITY, PARISH, TOWN OR 
NEIGHBOURHOOD COUNCILS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL TIERS OF REGIONAL 
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUBLISH A CHARTER OF SERVICES, GIVING 
CITIZENS CLEAR RIGHTS TO STANDARDS OF SERVICE, AND REMEDIES IF THESE 
ARE NOT MET. 
 
 ENSURING CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES

NO CITIZEN IS TRULY FREE UNLESS ALL ARE. INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS AND 
MINORITY COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES NEED PROTECTION AGAINST THE 
POWER OF THE STATE AND AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND UNFAIR 
TREATMENT. CITIZENS MUST HAVE RIGHTS OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION 
ABOUT DECISIONS TAKEN BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN THEIR NAME. WE 
WILL: 
¥ INTRODUCE A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, PLACING RESPONSIBILITY 
ON GOVERNMENT AND OTHER AUTHORITIES TO JUSTIFY SECRECY. WE WILL 
REVERSE THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT'S ENCROACHMENTS ON FREEDOM OF 
SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION, SUCH AS THE BANNING OF TRADE UNIONS AT 
GCHQ. WE WILL LEGISLATE TO GIVE INDIVIDUALS THE RIGHT OF ACCESS 
TO THEIR PERSONAL FILES, EXCEPT IN MATTERS RELATING TO NATIONAL 
SECURITY, WHETHER HELD BY PUBLIC OR PRIVATE BODIES. SECURITY 
SERVICES AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE TO A 
COMMITTEE OF SENIOR PRIVY COUNCILLORS. 
¥ ENACT A BILL OF RIGHTS BY IMMEDIATELY INCORPORATING THE 
EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND ITS PROTOCOLS INTO UK 
LAW. WE WILL CREATE A COMMISSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS TO HELP PEOPLE 
BRING PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE BILL AND TO RECOMMEND CHANGES IN 
EXISTING LAW AND PRACTICE. IN DUE COURSE WE WILL ADD RIGHTS AND 
FREEDOMS NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE CONVENTION, EXTENDING 
INTO A FULL UK BILL OF RIGHTS. 
¥ TAKE TOUGHER ACTION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. OUR BILL OF RIGHTS 
WILL GUARANTEE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ON THE 
GROUNDS OF SEX, RACE, AGE, DISABILITY, RELIGION OR SEXUAL 
ORIENTATION. OUR COMMISSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS WILL HELP 
INDIVIDUALS TAKE LEGAL ACTION IN CASES OF DISCRIMINATION. 
¥ END THE BIAS AGAINST WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE PRESENT 
POLITICAL SYSTEM. THE INTRODUCTION OF FAIR VOTES AND OF SENSIBLE 
PARLIAMENTARY CONDITIONS WILL INCREASE BOTH THE NUMBER OF 
WOMEN CANDIDATES AND THE NUMBER OF WOMEN MPS. IN ADDITION, 
WE WILL USE GOVERNMENT'S POWERS OF APPOINTMENT TO ENSURE FAIR 
REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN ON PUBLIC BODIES. ¥ IMPROVE THE 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A 
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, SEPARATING RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES 
AND JUSTICE FROM THAT FOR ORDER AND SECURITY. WE WILL ESTABLISH A 
JUDICIAL SERVICES COMMISSION TO APPOINT JUDGES. 
¥ ADOPT A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION, OF WHICH THE BILL OF RIGHTS WILL 
FORM THE CENTREPIECE. WE WILL CREATE A SUPREME COURT TO ENTRENCH 
AND DEFEND THESE FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS TO THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE CITIZEN AND THE STATE. 
 
 WORKING FOR PEACE: NORTHERN IRELAND

LIBERAL DEMOCRATS REJECT SIMPLISTIC SOLUTIONS FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND. WE AIM TO CONFRONT THE LEGITIMATE FEARS AND ASPIRATIONS 
OF BOTH COMMUNITIES. WE ACCEPT THAT BOTH THE UNIONIST AND 
NATIONALIST TRADITIONS ARE VALID AND LEGITIMATE; THAT NORTHERN 
IRELAND SHOULD REMAIN A PART OF THE UK UNTIL THE FREE CONSENT OF 
THE MAJORITY OF ITS PEOPLE IS GIVEN TO CHANGE; THAT THE REPUBLIC OF 
IRELAND HAS A LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN THE FUTURE OF NORTHERN IRELAND; 
AND THAT A PARTNERSHIP IN GOVERNMENT WHICH ALLOWS BOTH 
COMMUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IS THE ONLY PRACTICAL WAY IN WHICH TO 
MAKE PROGRESS.  
   TOGETHER WITH THE ALLIANCE PARTY, OUR SISTER PARTY AND THE ONLY 
NON-SECTARIAN POLITICAL PARTY IN NORTHERN IRELAND, WE BELIEVE THAT 
MUTUAL RESPECT, SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES AND DECENTRALISED 
GOVERNMENT ARE THE ONLY BASIS FOR A LASTING SOLUTION TO THE 
TROUBLES OF NORTHERN IRELAND. WE WILL WORK TOGETHER TO: 
¥ MAINTAIN THE ANGLO-LRISH AGREEMENT, UNLESS AND UNTIL AN 
IMPROVED AGREEMENT EMERGES FROM CROSS-PARTY TALKS TO REPLACE IT. 
¥ STRENGTHEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN 
NORTHERN IRELAND. THE CASE FOR FAIR VOTING FOR ALL ELECTIONS, TO 
BRING TOGETHER COMMUNITIES AND ENCOURAGE COOPERATION, AND FOR 
A BILL OF RIGHTS TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS, IS EVEN MORE PRESSING IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND THAN IT IS IN THE REST OF THE UK. WE WILL REFORM 
THE DIPLOCK SYSTEM, SO THAT THREE JUDGES PRESIDE OVER NON-JURY 
TRIALS, AND ENCOURAGE THE USE OF JURIES WHEREVER POSSIBLE. WE 
WILL INTRODUCE A 110-DAY LIMIT ON THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR WHICH A 
PRISONER MAY BE HELD BEFORE TRIAL, REPEAL THE BROADCASTING BAN, 
AND PROVIDE FOR THE VIDEOTAPING OF POLICE INTERVIEWS WITH 
TERRORIST SUSPECTS. 
¥ SUPPORT COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANISATIONS STRIVING FOR PEACE AND 
RECONCILIATION AND WORKING TO ELIMINATE SECTARIANISM AND 
DISCRIMINATION IN RELIGIOUS LIFE, EDUCATION, HOUSING AND POLITICS. 
¥ WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND ALSO BECAUSE IT CREATES A FRAMEWORK FOR 
PROGRESS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UK AND THE REPUBLIC OF 
IRELAND. 

  OUR PLEDGE

WHAT HAS BEEN SET OUT IN THESE PAGES IS A PROGRAMME WHICH 
COULD CHANGE BRITAIN FOR GOOD. WE COULD BECOME A COUNTRY OF 
CITIZENS, NOT SUBJECTS, STRIVING FOR EXCELLENCE RATHER THAN SETTLING 
FOR SECOND BEST. WE COULD BE ECONOMICALLY PROSPEROUS, 
ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AND EDUCATED TO OUR FULL POTENTIAL. 
BUT THE OBSTACLE TO NATIONAL SUCCESS IS THE BRITISH SYSTEM OF 
GOVERNMENT ITSELF. UNTIL THAT OUTDATED CHARADE IS SWEPT AWAY, 
BRITAIN'S DECLINE WILL CONTINUE, WHATEVER GOVERNMENT MAY BE IN 
POWER. THAT IS WHY LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING CONSTITUTIONAL 
CHANGE AT THE HEART OF OUR ELECTION CAMPAIGN. THE REFORM OF OUR 
OUTDATED AND UNDEMOCRATIC VOTING SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR IS THE 
CHANGE WHICH WILL MAKE OTHER REFORMS POSSIBLE AND IS THE KEY TO 
A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE. 
    BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN STABLE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT 
SUPPORTED BY A MAJORITY OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE, WE SHALL NOT ONLY 
CAMPAIGN WHOLEHEARTEDLY FOR FAIR VOTES IN THE COMING WEEKS, WE 
ALSO MAKE A PLEDGE FOR THE PERIOD AFTER THE ELECTION. OUR AIM WILL 
BE THE CREATION OF STABLE GOVERNMENT FOR A WHOLE PARLIAMENT AND 
A MORE DEMOCRATIC BASIS FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
WILL NEITHER SUPPORT NOR PARTICIPATE IN A GOVERNMENT WHICH TURNS 
ITS BACK ON REFORM. ANY MINORITY GOVERNMENT WHICH TRIES TO PLAY 
GAMES WITH THE CONSTITUTION IN ORDER TO CLING TO POWER, 
PROMOTING INSTABILITY AND DODGING THE MORAL CHALLENGE OF 
DEMOCRACY, WILL HAVE TO CONTEND WITH US.  
   THAT IS OUR PLEDGE. 

                                      LIBERAL DEMOCRAT APPOINTMENTS
