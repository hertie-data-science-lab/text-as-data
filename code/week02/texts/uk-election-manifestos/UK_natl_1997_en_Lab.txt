BRITAIN WILL BE BETTER WITH NEW LABOUR

'OUR CASE IS SIMPLE: THAT BRITAIN CAN AND MUST BE BETTER'
'THE VISION IS ONE OF NATIONAL RENEWAL, A COUNTRY WITH DRIVE, 
PURPOSE AND ENERGY'
'IN EACH AREA OF POLICY A NEW AND DISTINCTIVE APPROACH HAS BEEN 
MAPPED OUT, ONE THAT DIFFERS FROM THE OLD LEFT AND THE 
CONSERVATIVE RIGHT. THIS IS WHY NEW LABOUR IS NEW'
'NEW LABOUR IS A PARTY OF IDEAS AND IDEALS BUT NOT OF OUTDATED 
IDEOLOGY. WHAT COUNTS IS WHAT WORKS. THE OBJECTIVES ARE 
RADICAL. THE MEANS WILL BE MODERN'
'THIS IS OUR CONTRACT WITH THE PEOPLE'

I BELIEVE IN BRITAIN. IT IS A GREAT COUNTRY WITH A GREAT HISTORY. THE 
BRITISH PEOPLE ARE A GREAT PEOPLE.  BUT I BELIEVE BRITAIN CAN AND 
MUST BE BETTER: BETTER SCHOOLS, BETTER HOSPITALS, BETTER WAYS OF 
TACKLING CRIME, OF BUILDING A MODERN WELFARE STATE, OF EQUIPPING 
OURSELVES FOR A NEW WORLD ECONOMY.
I WANT A BRITAIN THAT IS ONE NATION, WITH SHARED VALUES AND 
PURPOSE, WHERE MERIT COMES BEFORE PRIVILEGE, RUN FOR THE MANY 
NOT THE FEW, STRONG AND SURE OF ITSELF AT HOME AND ABROAD.
I WANT A BRITAIN THAT DOES NOT SHUFFLE INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM 
AFRAID OF THE FUTURE, BUT STRIDES INTO IT WITH CONFIDENCE.
I WANT TO RENEW OUR COUNTRY'S FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF ITS 
GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS TO DELIVER THIS NEW BRITAIN.
I WANT TO DO IT BY MAKING A LIMITED SET OF IMPORTANT PROMISES AND 
ACHIEVING THEM. THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THE BOND OF TRUST I SET OUT 
AT THE END OF THIS INTRODUCTION, IN WHICH TEN SPECIFIC 
COMMITMENTS ARE PUT BEFORE YOU. HOLD US TO THEM. THEY ARE OUR 
COVENANT WITH YOU. 
I WANT TO RENEW FAITH IN POLITICS BY BEING HONEST ABOUT THE LAST 18 
YEARS. SOME THINGS THE CONSERVATIVES GOT RIGHT. WE WILL NOT 
CHANGE THEM. IT IS WHERE THEY GOT THINGS WRONG THAT WE WILL 
MAKE CHANGE. WE HAVE NO INTENTION OR DESIRE TO REPLACE ONE SET 
OF DOGMAS BY ANOTHER. 
I WANT TO RENEW FAITH IN POLITICS THROUGH A GOVERNMENT THAT WILL 
GOVERN IN THE INTEREST OF THE MANY, THE BROAD MAJORITY OF PEOPLE 
WHO WORK HARD, PLAY BY THE RULES, PAY THEIR DUES AND FEEL LET 
DOWN BY A POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT GIVES THE BREAKS TO THE FEW, TO AN 
ELITE AT THE TOP INCREASINGLY OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE REST OF US.
AND I WANT, ABOVE ALL, TO GOVERN IN A WAY THAT BRINGS OUR 
COUNTRY TOGETHER, THAT UNITES OUR NATION IN FACING THE TOUGH AND 
DANGEROUS CHALLENGES OF THE NEW ECONOMY AND CHANGED SOCIETY 
IN WHICH WE MUST LIVE. I WANT A BRITAIN WHICH WE ALL FEEL PART OF, 
IN WHOSE FUTURE WE ALL HAVE A STAKE, IN WHICH WHAT I WANT FOR 
MY OWN CHILDREN I WANT FOR YOURS.


A NEW POLITICS

THE REASON FOR HAVING CREATED NEW LABOUR IS TO MEET THE 
CHALLENGES OF A DIFFERENT WORLD. THE MILLENNIUM SYMBOLISES A 
NEW ERA OPENING UP FOR BRITAIN. I AM CONFIDENT ABOUT OUR FUTURE 
PROSPERITY, EVEN OPTIMISTIC, IF WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO CHANGE 
AND USE IT TO BUILD A BETTER BRITAIN.
 TO ACCOMPLISH THIS MEANS MORE THAN JUST A CHANGE OF 
GOVERNMENT. OUR AIM IS NO LESS THAN TO SET BRITISH POLITICAL LIFE 
ON A NEW COURSE FOR THE FUTURE.
PEOPLE ARE CYNICAL ABOUT POLITICS AND DISTRUSTFUL OF POLITICAL 
PROMISES. THAT IS HARDLY SURPRISING. THERE HAVE BEEN FEW MORE 
GROSS BREACHES OF FAITH THAN WHEN THE CONSERVATIVES UNDER MR 
MAJOR PROMISED, BEFORE THE ELECTION OF 1992, THAT THEY WOULD NOT 
RAISE TAXES, BUT WOULD CUT THEM EVERY YEAR; AND THEN WENT ON TO 
RAISE THEM BY THE LARGEST AMOUNT IN PEACETIME HISTORY STARTING IN 
THE FIRST BUDGET AFTER THE ELECTION. THE EXCHANGE RATE 
MECHANISM AS THE CORNERSTONE OF ECONOMIC POLICY, EUROPE, 
HEALTH, CRIME, SCHOOLS, SLEAZE - THE BROKEN PROMISES ARE STREWN 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY'S MEMORY.
THE CONSERVATIVES' BROKEN PROMISES TAINT ALL POLITICS. THAT IS 
WHY WE HAVE MADE IT OUR GUIDING RULE NOT TO PROMISE WHAT WE 
CANNOT DELIVER; AND TO DELIVER WHAT WE PROMISE. WHAT FOLLOWS IS 
NOT THE POLITICS OF A 100 DAYS THAT DAZZLES FOR A TIME, THEN FIZZLES 
OUT. IT IS NOT THE POLITICS OF A REVOLUTION, BUT OF A FRESH START, THE 
PATIENT REBUILDING AND RENEWING OF THIS COUNTRY - RENEWAL THAT 
CAN TAKE ROOT AND BUILD OVER TIME. 
THAT IS ONE WAY IN WHICH POLITICS IN BRITAIN WILL GAIN A NEW LEASE 
OF LIFE. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER. WE AIM TO PUT BEHIND US THE BITTER 
POLITICAL STRUGGLES OF LEFT AND RIGHT THAT HAVE TORN OUR COUNTRY 
APART FOR TOO MANY DECADES. MANY OF THESE CONFLICTS HAVE NO 
RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER TO THE MODERN WORLD - PUBLIC VERSUS 
PRIVATE, BOSSES VERSUS WORKERS, MIDDLE CLASS VERSUS WORKING 
CLASS. IT IS TIME FOR THIS COUNTRY TO MOVE ON AND MOVE FORWARD. 
WE ARE PROUD OF OUR HISTORY, PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED - 
BUT WE MUST LEARN FROM OUR HISTORY, NOT BE CHAINED TO IT.


NEW LABOUR

THE PURPOSE OF NEW LABOUR IS TO GIVE BRITAIN A DIFFERENT POLITICAL 
CHOICE: THE CHOICE BETWEEN A FAILED CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT, 
EXHAUSTED AND DIVIDED IN EVERYTHING OTHER THAN ITS DESIRE TO CLING 
ON TO POWER, AND A NEW AND REVITALISED LABOUR PARTY THAT HAS 
BEEN RESOLUTE IN TRANSFORMING ITSELF INTO A PARTY OF THE FUTURE. 
WE HAVE REWRITTEN OUR CONSTITUTION, THE NEW CLAUSE IV, TO PUT A 
COMMITMENT TO ENTERPRISE ALONGSIDE THE COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE. 
WE HAVE CHANGED THE WAY WE MAKE POLICY, AND PUT OUR RELATIONS 
WITH THE TRADE UNIONS ON A MODERN FOOTING WHERE THEY ACCEPT 
THEY CAN GET FAIRNESS BUT NO FAVOURS FROM A LABOUR GOVERNMENT. 
OUR MPS ARE ALL NOW SELECTED BY ORDINARY PARTY MEMBERS, NOT 
SMALL COMMITTEES OR PRESSURE GROUPS. THE MEMBERSHIP ITSELF HAS 
DOUBLED, TO OVER 400,000, WITH HALF THE MEMBERS HAVING JOINED 
SINCE THE LAST ELECTION. 
WE SUBMITTED OUR DRAFT MANIFESTO, NEW LABOUR NEW LIFE FOR 
BRITAIN, TO A BALLOT OF ALL OUR MEMBERS, 95 PER CENT OF WHOM 
GAVE IT THEIR EXPRESS ENDORSEMENT.
WE ARE A NATIONAL PARTY, SUPPORTED TODAY BY PEOPLE FROM ALL 
WALKS OF LIFE, FROM THE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN OR WOMAN TO THE 
PENSIONER ON A COUNCIL ESTATE. YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE FLOODED IN TO 
JOIN US IN WHAT IS THE FASTEST GROWING YOUTH SECTION OF ANY 
POLITICAL PARTY IN THE WESTERN WORLD.


THE VISION

WE ARE A BROAD-BASED MOVEMENT FOR PROGRESS AND JUSTICE. NEW 
LABOUR IS THE POLITICAL ARM OF NONE OTHER THAN THE BRITISH PEOPLE 
AS A WHOLE. OUR VALUES ARE THE SAME: THE EQUAL WORTH OF ALL, WITH 
NO ONE CAST ASIDE; FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE WITHIN STRONG 
COMMUNITIES. 
BUT WE HAVE LIBERATED THESE VALUES FROM OUTDATED DOGMA OR 
DOCTRINE, AND WE HAVE APPLIED THESE VALUES TO THE MODERN WORLD.
I WANT A COUNTRY IN WHICH PEOPLE GET ON, DO WELL, MAKE A 
SUCCESS OF THEIR LIVES. I HAVE NO TIME FOR THE POLITICS OF ENVY. WE 
NEED MORE SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS, NOT FEWER OF THEM. BUT 
THESE LIFE-CHANCES SHOULD BE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. AND I WANT A 
SOCIETY IN WHICH AMBITION AND COMPASSION ARE SEEN AS PARTNERS 
NOT OPPOSITES - WHERE WE VALUE PUBLIC SERVICE AS WELL AS MATERIAL 
WEALTH.
NEW LABOUR BELIEVES IN A SOCIETY WHERE WE DO NOT SIMPLY 
PURSUE OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL AIMS BUT WHERE WE HOLD MANY AIMS 
IN COMMON AND WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THEM. HOW WE BUILD 
THE INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES OF THE FUTURE; HOW 
WE TACKLE THE DIVISION AND INEQUALITY IN OUR SOCIETY; HOW WE CARE 
FOR AND ENHANCE OUR ENVIRONMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE; HOW WE 
DEVELOP MODERN EDUCATION AND HEALTH SERVICES; HOW WE CREATE 
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SAFE, WHERE MUTUAL RESPECT AND TOLERANCE 
ARE THE ORDER OF THE DAY. THESE ARE THINGS WE MUST ACHIEVE 
TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY.
THE VISION IS ONE OF NATIONAL RENEWAL, A COUNTRY WITH DRIVE, 
PURPOSE AND ENERGY. A BRITAIN EQUIPPED TO PROSPER IN A GLOBAL 
ECONOMY OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE; WITH A MODERN WELFARE STATE; 
ITS POLITICS MORE ACCOUNTABLE; AND CONFIDENT OF ITS PLACE IN THE 
WORLD.


PROGRAMME: A NEW CENTRE AND CENTRE-LEFT POLITICS

IN EACH AREA OF POLICY A NEW AND DISTINCTIVE APPROACH HAS BEEN 
MAPPED OUT, ONE THAT DIFFERS BOTH FROM THE SOLUTIONS OF THE OLD 
LEFT AND THOSE OF THE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT. THIS IS WHY NEW LABOUR 
IS NEW. WE BELIEVE IN THE STRENGTH OF OUR VALUES, BUT WE 
RECOGNISE ALSO THAT THE POLICIES OF 1997 CANNOT BE THOSE OF 1947 
OR 1967. MORE DETAILED POLICY HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY US THAN BY 
ANY OPPOSITION IN HISTORY. OUR DIRECTION AND DESTINATION ARE 
CLEAR. 
THE OLD LEFT WOULD HAVE SOUGHT STATE CONTROL OF INDUSTRY. THE 
CONSERVATIVE RIGHT IS CONTENT TO LEAVE ALL TO THE MARKET. WE REJECT 
BOTH APPROACHES. GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY MUST WORK TOGETHER 
TO ACHIEVE KEY OBJECTIVES AIMED AT ENHANCING THE DYNAMISM OF 
THE MARKET, NOT UNDERMINING IT. 
IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, WE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO 
RETURN TO FLYING PICKETS, SECONDARY ACTION, STRIKES WITH NO BALLOTS 
OR THE TRADE UNION LAW OF THE 1970S. THERE WILL INSTEAD BE BASIC 
MINIMUM RIGHTS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AT THE WORKPLACE, WHERE OUR 
AIM IS PARTNERSHIP NOT CONFLICT BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND 
EMPLOYEES.
IN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, WE ACCEPT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AS A 
REALITY AND REJECT THE ISOLATIONISM AND 'GO-IT-ALONE' POLICIES OF THE 
EXTREMES OF RIGHT OR LEFT.
IN EDUCATION, WE REJECT BOTH THE IDEA OF A RETURN TO THE 11-PLUS 
AND THE MONOLITHIC COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS THAT TAKE NO ACCOUNT 
OF CHILDREN'S DIFFERING ABILITIES. INSTEAD WE FAVOUR ALL-IN 
SCHOOLING WHICH IDENTIFIES THE DISTINCT ABILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL 
PUPILS AND ORGANISES THEM IN CLASSES TO MAXIMISE THEIR PROGRESS 
IN INDIVIDUAL SUBJECTS. IN THIS WAY WE MODERNISE THE 
COMPREHENSIVE PRINCIPLE, LEARNING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF ITS 30 
YEARS OF APPLICATION.
IN HEALTH POLICY, WE WILL SAFEGUARD 
THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE NHS, WHICH WE FOUNDED, BUT WILL NOT 
RETURN TO THE TOP-DOWN MANAGEMENT OF THE 1970S. SO WE WILL 
KEEP THE PLANNING AND PROVISION OF HEALTHCARE SEPARATE, BUT PUT 
PLANNING ON A LONGER-TERM, DECENTRALISED AND MORE CO-OPERATIVE 
BASIS. THE KEY IS TO ROOT OUT UNNECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE COST, 
AND TO SPEND MONEY ON THE RIGHT THINGS - FRONTLINE CARE.
ON CRIME, WE BELIEVE IN PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND IN PUNISHING 
CRIME, BUT ALSO TACKLING ITS UNDERLYING CAUSES - SO, TOUGH ON 
CRIME, TOUGH ON THE CAUSES OF CRIME, DIFFERENT FROM THE LABOUR 
APPROACH OF THE PAST AND THE TORY POLICY OF TODAY.
OVER-CENTRALISATION OF GOVERNMENT AND LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY WAS 
A PROBLEM IN GOVERNMENTS OF BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT. LABOUR IS 
COMMITTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC RENEWAL OF OUR COUNTRY THROUGH 
DECENTRALISATION AND THE ELIMINATION OF EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT 
SECRECY.
IN ADDITION, WE WILL FACE UP TO THE NEW ISSUES THAT CONFRONT US. 
WE WILL BE THE PARTY OF WELFARE REFORM. IN CONSULTATION AND 
PARTNERSHIP WITH
THE PEOPLE, WE WILL DESIGN A MODERN WELFARE STATE BASED ON 
RIGHTS AND DUTIES GOING TOGETHER, FIT FOR THE MODERN WORLD. 
WE WILL STAND UP FOR BRITAIN'S INTERESTS IN EUROPE AFTER THE 
SHAMBLES OF THE LAST SIX YEARS, BUT, MORE THAN THAT, WE WILL LEAD A 
CAMPAIGN FOR REFORM IN EUROPE. EUROPE ISN'T WORKING IN THE WAY 
THIS COUNTRY AND EUROPE NEED. BUT TO LEAD MEANS TO BE INVOLVED, 
TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE, TO BE CAPABLE OF GETTING OUR OWN WAY.
WE WILL PUT CONCERN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AT THE HEART OF POLICY-
MAKING, SO THAT IT IS NOT AN ADD-ON EXTRA, BUT INFORMS THE WHOLE 
OF GOVERNMENT, FROM HOUSING AND ENERGY POLICY THROUGH TO 
GLOBAL WARMING AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.
WE WILL SEARCH OUT AT EVERY TURN NEW WAYS AND NEW IDEAS TO 
TACKLE THE NEW ISSUES: HOW TO ENCOURAGE MORE FLEXIBLE WORKING 
HOURS AND PRACTICES TO SUIT EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE; HOW 
TO HARNESS THE HUGE POTENTIAL OF THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; 
HOW TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESSES OF THE GOVERNMENT MACHINE; HOW 
TO PUT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP TO GIVE US 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORT SYSTEM WE NEED.
WE WILL BE A RADICAL GOVERNMENT. 
BUT THE DEFINITION OF RADICALISM WILL NOT BE THAT OF DOCTRINE, 
WHETHER OF LEFT OR RIGHT, BUT OF ACHIEVEMENT. 
NEW LABOUR IS A PARTY OF IDEAS AND IDEALS BUT NOT OF OUTDATED 
IDEOLOGY. WHAT COUNTS IS WHAT WORKS. THE OBJECTIVES ARE 
RADICAL. THE MEANS WILL BE MODERN.
SO THE PARTY IS TRANSFORMED. THE VISION IS CLEAR. AND FROM THAT 
VISION STEMS A MODERN PROGRAMME OF CHANGE AND RENEWAL FOR 
BRITAIN. 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT AFTER 18 YEARS OF ONE-PARTY RULE, PEOPLE WANT 
CHANGE, BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE COUNTRY AND FOR 
DEMOCRACY, BUT REQUIRE FAITH TO MAKE THE CHANGE.
WE THEREFORE SET OUT IN THE MANIFESTO THAT FOLLOWS TEN 
COMMITMENTS, COMMITMENTS THAT FORM OUR BOND OF TRUST WITH THE 
PEOPLE. THEY ARE SPECIFIC. THEY ARE REAL. JUDGE US ON THEM. 
HAVE TRUST IN US AND WE WILL REPAY THAT TRUST.
OUR MISSION IN POLITICS IS TO REBUILD THIS BOND OF TRUST BETWEEN 
GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY DEMOCRACY CAN 
FLOURISH. I PLEDGE TO BRITAIN A GOVERNMENT WHICH SHARES THEIR 
HOPES, WHICH UNDERSTANDS THEIR FEARS, AND WHICH WILL WORK AS 
PARTNERS WITH AND FOR ALL OUR PEOPLE, NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGED FEW. 
THIS IS OUR CONTRACT WITH THE PEOPLE. 


OVER THE FIVE YEARS OF A LABOUR GOVERNMENT:

1 	EDUCATION WILL BE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY, AND WE WILL 
INCREASE THE SHARE OF NATIONAL INCOME SPENT ON EDUCATION AS WE 
DECREASE IT ON THE BILLS OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FAILURE

2 	THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN THE BASIC OR TOP RATES OF 
INCOME TAX

3 	WE WILL PROVIDE STABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW 
INFLATION, AND PROMOTE DYNAMIC AND COMPETITIVE BUSINESS AND 
INDUSTRY AT HOME AND ABROAD

4 	WE WILL GET 250,000 YOUNG UNEMPLOYED OFF BENEFIT AND 
INTO WORK

5 	WE WILL REBUILD THE NHS, REDUCING SPENDING ON 
ADMINISTRATION AND INCREASING SPENDING ON PATIENT CARE

6 	WE WILL BE TOUGH ON CRIME AND TOUGH ON THE CAUSES OF 
CRIME, AND HALVE THE TIME IT TAKES PERSISTENT JUVENILE OFFENDERS TO 
COME TO COURT

7 	WE WILL HELP BUILD STRONG FAMILIES AND STRONG 
COMMUNITIES, AND LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF A MODERN WELFARE STATE 
IN PENSIONS AND COMMUNITY CARE

8 	WE WILL SAFEGUARD OUR ENVIRONMENT, AND DEVELOP AN 
INTEGRATED TRANSPORT POLICY TO FIGHT CONGESTION AND POLLUTION

9 	WE WILL CLEAN UP POLITICS, DECENTRALISE POLITICAL POWER 
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM AND PUT THE FUNDING OF POLITICAL 
PARTIES ON A PROPER AND ACCOUNTABLE BASIS

10 WE WILL GIVE BRITAIN THE LEADERSHIP IN EUROPE WHICH BRITAIN 
AND EUROPE NEED

WE HAVE MODERNISED THE LABOUR PARTY AND WE WILL MODERNISE 
BRITAIN. THIS MEANS KNOWING WHERE WE WANT TO GO; BEING CLEAR-
HEADED ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE; TELLING THE TRUTH; MAKING TOUGH 
CHOICES; INSISTING THAT ALL PARTS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR LIVE WITHIN 
THEIR MEANS; TAKING ON VESTED INTERESTS THAT HOLD PEOPLE BACK; 
STANDING UP TO UNREASONABLE DEMANDS FROM ANY QUARTER; AND 
BEING PREPARED TO GIVE A MORAL LEAD WHERE GOVERNMENT HAS 
RESPONSIBILITIES
IT SHOULD NOT AVOID.
BRITAIN DOES DESERVE BETTER. AND NEW LABOUR WILL BE BETTER FOR 
BRITAIN.


WE WILL
MAKE EDUCATION OUR 
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY


- CUT CLASS SIZES TO 30 OR UNDER FOR 5, 6 AND 7 YEAR-OLDS
- NURSERY PLACES FOR ALL FOUR YEAR-OLDS
- ATTACK LOW STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS
- ACCESS TO COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY
- LIFELONG LEARNING THROUGH A NEW UNIVERSITY FOR INDUSTRY
- MORE SPENDING ON EDUCATION AS THE COST OF UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS


EDUCATION HAS BEEN THE TORIES' BIGGEST FAILURE. IT IS LABOUR'S 
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.  
IT IS NOT JUST GOOD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. IT IS AN ECONOMIC NECESSITY 
FOR THE NATION. WE WILL COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON THE BASIS OF 
QUALITY OR NOT AT ALL. AND QUALITY COMES FROM DEVELOPING THE 
POTENTIAL OF ALL OUR PEOPLE. IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUR GREATEST 
NATURAL ASSET. WE WILL ENSURE THEY CAN FULFIL THEIR POTENTIAL.
NEARLY HALF OF 11 YEAR-OLDS IN ENGLAND AND WALES FAIL TO REACH 
EXPECTED STANDARDS IN ENGLISH AND MATHS. BRITAIN HAS A SMALLER 
SHARE OF 17 AND 18 YEAR-OLDS IN FULL-TIME EDUCATION THAN ANY 
MAJOR INDUSTRIAL NATION. NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE
BRITISH WORKFORCE LACK VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS.
THERE ARE EXCELLENT SCHOOLS IN BRITAIN'S STATE EDUCATION SYSTEM. 
BUT FAR TOO MANY CHILDREN ARE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. 
OUR TASK IS TO RAISE THE STANDARDS OF EVERY SCHOOL.
WE WILL PUT BEHIND US THE OLD ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEDEVILLED 
EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY. WE REJECT THE TORIES' OBSESSION WITH 
SCHOOL STRUCTURES: ALL PARENTS SHOULD BE OFFERED REAL CHOICE 
THROUGH GOOD QUALITY SCHOOLS, EACH WITH ITS OWN STRENGTHS AND 
INDIVIDUAL ETHOS. THERE SHOULD BE NO RETURN TO THE 11-PLUS.
IT DIVIDES CHILDREN INTO SUCCESSES AND FAILURES AT FAR TOO EARLY AN 
AGE.
WE MUST MODERNISE COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS. CHILDREN ARE NOT ALL 
OF THE SAME ABILITY, NOR DO THEY LEARN AT THE SAME SPEED. THAT 
MEANS 'SETTING' CHILDREN IN CLASSES TO MAXIMISE PROGRESS, FOR THE 
BENEFIT OF HIGH-FLIERS AND SLOWER LEARNERS ALIKE. THE FOCUS MUST 
BE ON LEVELLING UP, NOT LEVELLING DOWN. 
WITH LABOUR, THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT 
WILL BECOME A LEADING OFFICE OF STATE. IT WILL GIVE A STRONG AND 
CONSISTENT LEAD TO HELP RAISE STANDARDS IN EVERY SCHOOL. 
STANDARDS, MORE THAN STRUCTURES, ARE THE KEY TO SUCCESS. LABOUR 
WILL NEVER PUT DOGMA BEFORE CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. OUR APPROACH 
WILL BE TO INTERVENE WHERE THERE ARE PROBLEMS, NOT WHERE SCHOOLS 
ARE SUCCEEDING.
LABOUR WILL NEVER FORCE THE ABOLITION OF GOOD SCHOOLS WHETHER IN 
THE PRIVATE OR STATE SECTOR. ANY CHANGES IN THE ADMISSIONS 
POLICIES OF GRAMMAR SCHOOLS WILL BE DECIDED BY LOCAL PARENTS. 
CHURCH SCHOOLS WILL RETAIN THEIR DISTINCTIVE RELIGIOUS ETHOS.
WE WISH TO BUILD BRIDGES WHEREVER WE CAN ACROSS EDUCATION 
DIVIDES. THE EDUCATIONAL APARTHEID CREATED BY THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE 
DIVIDE DIMINISHES THE WHOLE EDUCATION SYSTEM. 


ZERO TOLERANCE OF UNDERPERFORMANCE  

EVERY SCHOOL HAS THE CAPACITY TO SUCCEED. ALL LOCAL EDUCATION 
AUTHORITIES (LEAS) MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT EVERY SCHOOL IS 
IMPROVING. FOR THOSE FAILING SCHOOLS UNABLE TO IMPROVE, 
MINISTERS WILL ORDER A 'FRESH START' - CLOSE THE SCHOOL AND START 
AFRESH ON THE SAME SITE. WHERE GOOD SCHOOLS AND BAD SCHOOLS 
COEXIST SIDE BY SIDE WE WILL AUTHORISE LEAS TO ALLOW ONE SCHOOL 
TO TAKE OVER THE OTHER TO SET THE UNDERPERFORMING SCHOOL ON A 
NEW PATH. 


QUALITY NURSERY EDUCATION GUARANTEED FOR ALL FOUR YEAR-OLDS

NURSERY VOUCHERS HAVE BEEN PROVEN NOT TO WORK. THEY ARE 
COSTLY AND DO NOT GENERATE MORE QUALITY NURSERY PLACES. WE WILL 
USE THE MONEY SAVED BY SCRAPPING NURSERY VOUCHERS TO 
GUARANTEE PLACES FOR FOUR YEAR-OLDS. WE WILL INVITE SELECTED LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES TO PILOT EARLY EXCELLENCE CENTRES COMBINING EDUCATION 
AND CARE FOR THE UNDER-FIVES. WE WILL SET TARGETS FOR UNIVERSAL 
PROVISION FOR THREE YEAR-OLDS WHOSE PARENTS WANT IT.  


NEW FOCUS ON STANDARDS IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS

PRIMARY SCHOOLS ARE THE KEY TO MASTERING THE BASICS AND 
DEVELOPING IN EVERY CHILD AN EAGERNESS TO LEARN.  
EVERY SCHOOL NEEDS BASELINE ASSESSMENT OF PUPILS WHEN THEY 
ENTER THE SCHOOL, AND A YEAR-ON-YEAR TARGET FOR IMPROVEMENT. 
WE WILL REDUCE CLASS SIZES FOR FIVE, SIX AND SEVEN YEAR-OLDS TO 30 
OR UNDER, BY PHASING OUT THE ASSISTED PLACES SCHEME, THE COST OF 
WHICH IS SET TO RISE TO 180 MILLION POUNDS PER YEAR.  
WE MUST RECOGNISE THE THREE 'R'S FOR WHAT THEY ARE - BUILDING 
BLOCKS OF ALL LEARNING THAT MUST BE TAUGHT BETTER. WE WILL ACHIEVE 
THIS BY IMPROVING THE SKILLS OF THE TEACHING FORCE; ENSURING A 
STRONGER FOCUS ON LITERACY IN THE CURRICULUM; AND PILOTING LITERACY 
SUMMER SCHOOLS TO MEET OUR NEW TARGET THAT WITHIN A DECADE 
EVERY CHILD LEAVES PRIMARY SCHOOL WITH A READING AGE OF
AT LEAST 11 (BARELY HALF DO TODAY). 
OUR NUMERACY TASKFORCE WILL DEVELOP EQUALLY AMBITIOUS TARGETS. 
WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE USE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TEACHING 
METHODS, INCLUDING PHONICS FOR READING AND WHOLE CLASS 
INTERACTIVE TEACHING FOR MATHS. 


ATTACKING EDUCATIONAL DISADVANTAGE  

NO MATTER WHERE A SCHOOL IS, LABOUR WILL NOT TOLERATE UNDER-
ACHIEVEMENT.
PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WILL IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF SCHOOL 
BUILDINGS.  
THERE WILL BE EDUCATION ACTION ZONES TO ATTACK LOW STANDARDS BY 
RECRUITING THE BEST TEACHERS AND HEAD TEACHERS TO UNDER-ACHIEVING 
SCHOOLS; BY SUPPORTING VOLUNTARY MENTORING SCHEMES TO PROVIDE 
ONE-TO-ONE SUPPORT FOR DISADVANTAGED PUPILS; AND BY CREATING 
NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN, AFTER THE AGE OF 14, TO ENHANCE 
THEIR STUDIES BY ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE WITHIN 
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE. 
TO ATTACK UNDER-ACHIEVEMENT IN URBAN AREAS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED 
A NEW SCHEME WITH THE PREMIER LEAGUE. IN PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND FOOTBALL CLUBS, STUDY 
SUPPORT CENTRES WILL BE SET UP AT PREMIER LEAGUE GROUNDS FOR THE 
BENEFIT OF LOCAL CHILDREN. THE SCHEME WILL BE LAUNCHED ON A PILOT 
BASIS DURING THE 1997/8 SEASON.
WE SUPPORT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE INTEGRATION INTO MAINSTREAM 
EDUCATION OF PUPILS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS, WHILE 
RECOGNISING THAT SPECIALIST FACILITIES ARE ESSENTIAL TO MEET 
PARTICULAR NEEDS. 


REALISING THE POTENTIAL OF NEW TECHNOLOGY 

LABOUR IS THE PIONEER OF NEW THINKING.  WE HAVE AGREED WITH 
BRITISH TELECOM AND THE CABLE COMPANIES THAT THEY WILL WIRE UP 
SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES, COLLEGES AND HOSPITALS TO THE INFORMATION 
SUPERHIGHWAY FREE OF CHARGE. WE HAVE ALSO SECURED AGREEMENT 
TO MAKE ACCESS CHARGES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE.  
FOR THE INTERNET WE PLAN A NATIONAL GRID FOR LEARNING, 
FRANCHISED AS A PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP, WHICH WILL BRING TO 
TEACHERS UP-TO-DATE MATERIALS TO ENHANCE THEIR SKILLS, AND TO 
CHILDREN HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS. WE WILL USE LOTTERY 
MONEY TO IMPROVE THE SKILLS OF EXISTING TEACHERS IN INFORMATION 
TECHNOLOGY.  
IN OPPOSITION, LABOUR SET UP THE INDEPENDENT STEVENSON 
COMMISSION TO PROMOTE ACCESS FOR CHILDREN TO NEW TECHNOLOGY. 
ITS RECENT REPORT IS A CHALLENGING PROGRAMME FOR THE FUTURE.  WE 
ARE URGENTLY EXAMINING HOW TO IMPLEMENT ITS PLANS, IN PARTICULAR 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE THROUGH A GRADING 
SYSTEM WHICH WILL PROVIDE SCHOOLS WITH GUARANTEES OF PRODUCT 
QUALITY; AND THE PROVISION FOR EVERY CHILD OF AN INDIVIDUAL EMAIL 
ADDRESS. AN INDEPENDENT STANDING COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO 
ADVISE US ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR PLANS IN GOVERNMENT.


THE ROLE OF PARENTS 

WE WILL INCREASE THE POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARENTS.
THERE WILL BE MORE PARENT GOVERNORS AND, FOR THE FIRST TIME, 
PARENT REPRESENTATIVES ON LEAS.
A MAJOR OBJECTIVE IS TO PROMOTE A CULTURE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
LEARNING WITHIN THE FAMILY, THROUGH CONTRACTS BETWEEN ALL SCHOOLS 
AND PARENTS, DEFINING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF EACH. NATIONAL 
GUIDELINES WILL ESTABLISH MINIMUM PERIODS FOR HOMEWORK FOR 
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL PUPILS.
TEACHERS WILL BE ENTITLED TO POSITIVE SUPPORT FROM PARENTS TO 
PROMOTE GOOD ATTENDANCE AND SOUND DISCIPLINE. SCHOOLS SUFFER 
FROM UNRULY AND DISRUPTIVE PUPILS. EXCLUSION OR SUSPENSION MAY 
SOMETIMES BE NECESSARY. WE WILL, HOWEVER, PILOT NEW PUPIL 
REFERRAL UNITS SO THAT SCHOOLS ARE PROTECTED BUT THESE PUPILS ARE 
NOT LOST TO EDUCATION OR
THE COUNTRY.


NEW JOB DESCRIPTION FOR LEAS  

THE JUDGE AND JURY OF LEA PERFORMANCE WILL BE THEIR 
CONTRIBUTION TO RAISING STANDARDS. 
LEAS ARE CLOSER TO SCHOOLS THAN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, AND HAVE 
THE AUTHORITY OF BEING LOCALLY ELECTED. BUT THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO 
DEVOLVE POWER, AND MORE OF THEIR BUDGETS,
TO HEADS AND GOVERNORS. LEA PERFORMANCE WILL BE INSPECTED BY 
OFSTED AND THE AUDIT COMMISSION. WHERE AUTHORITIES ARE DEEMED 
TO BE FAILING, THE SECRETARY OF STATE MAY SUSPEND THE RELEVANT 
POWERS OF THE LEA AND SEND IN AN IMPROVEMENT TEAM.


GRANT MAINTAINED SCHOOLS

SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOW GRANT MAINTAINED WILL PROSPER WITH 
LABOUR'S PROPOSALS, AS WILL EVERY SCHOOL. 
TORY CLAIMS THAT LABOUR WILL CLOSE THESE SCHOOLS ARE FALSE. THE 
SYSTEM OF FUNDING WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE UNFAIRLY EITHER BETWEEN 
SCHOOLS OR BETWEEN PUPILS. LEAS WILL BE REPRESENTED ON 
GOVERNING BODIES, BUT WILL NOT CONTROL THEM. WE SUPPORT 
GUIDELINES FOR OPEN AND FAIR ADMISSIONS, ALONG THE LINES OF THOSE 
INTRODUCED IN 1993; BUT WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE A RIGHT OF APPEAL TO 
AN INDEPENDENT PANEL IN DISPUTED CASES. 


TEACHERS: PRESSURE AND SUPPORT

SCHOOLS ARE CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON THE QUALITY OF ALL STAFF. THE 
MAJORITY OF TEACHERS ARE SKILFUL AND DEDICATED, BUT SOME FALL 
SHORT. WE WILL IMPROVE TEACHER TRAINING, AND ENSURE THAT ALL 
TEACHERS HAVE AN INDUCTION YEAR WHEN THEY FIRST QUALIFY, TO 
ENSURE THEIR SUITABILITY FOR TEACHING.
THERE WILL BE A GENERAL TEACHING COUNCIL TO SPEAK FOR AND RAISE 
STANDARDS IN THE PROFESSION. WE WILL CREATE A NEW GRADE OF 
TEACHERS TO RECOGNISE THE BEST. THERE WILL, HOWEVER, BE SPEEDY, 
BUT FAIR, PROCEDURES TO REMOVE TEACHERS WHO CANNOT DO THE JOB. 
THE STRENGTH OF A SCHOOL IS CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON THE QUALITY OF 
ITS HEAD. WE WILL ESTABLISH MANDATORY QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE POST. 
A HEAD TEACHER WILL BE APPOINTED TO A POSITION ONLY WHEN FULLY 
TRAINED TO ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY. 


HIGHER EDUCATION
 
THE IMPROVEMENT AND EXPANSION NEEDED CANNOT BE FUNDED OUT OF 
GENERAL TAXATION. OUR PROPOSALS FOR FUNDING HAVE BEEN MADE TO 
THE DEARING COMMITTEE, IN LINE WITH SUCCESSFUL POLICIES ABROAD.
THE COSTS OF STUDENT MAINTENANCE SHOULD BE REPAID BY GRADUATES 
ON AN INCOME-RELATED BASIS, FROM THE CAREER SUCCESS TO WHICH 
HIGHER EDUCATION HAS CONTRIBUTED. THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BADLY 
ADMINISTERED AND PAYBACK PERIODS ARE TOO SHORT. WE WILL PROVIDE 
EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION, WITH FAIRNESS ENSURED BY LONGER PAYBACK 
PERIODS WHERE REQUIRED.


LIFELONG LEARNING 

WE MUST LEARN THROUGHOUT LIFE, TO RETAIN EMPLOYMENT THROUGH 
NEW AND IMPROVED SKILLS. WE WILL PROMOTE ADULT LEARNING BOTH AT 
WORK AND IN THE CRITICAL SECTOR OF FURTHER EDUCATION.
IN SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES, WE SUPPORT BROADER A-LEVELS AND 
UPGRADED VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS, UNDERPINNED BY RIGOROUS 
STANDARDS AND KEY SKILLS. 
EMPLOYERS HAVE THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRAINING THEIR 
WORKFORCES IN JOB-RELATED SKILLS. BUT INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE GIVEN 
THE POWER TO INVEST IN TRAINING. WE WILL INVEST PUBLIC MONEY FOR 
TRAINING IN INDIVIDUAL LEARNING ACCOUNTS WHICH INDIVIDUALS 
- FOR EXAMPLE WOMEN RETURNING TO THE LABOUR FORCE - CAN THEN 
USE TO GAIN THE SKILLS THEY WANT. WE WILL KICKSTART THE PROGRAMME 
FOR UP TO A MILLION PEOPLE, USING 150 MILLION POUNDS OF TEC 
MONEY WHICH COULD BE BETTER USED AND WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A 
CONTRIBUTION OF 150 POUNDS, ALONGSIDE INDIVIDUALS MAKING SMALL 
INVESTMENTS OF THEIR OWN. EMPLOYERS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO 
MAKE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE FUNDS. WE WILL ALSO 
PROMOTE THE EXTENSION OF THE INVESTORS IN PEOPLE INITIATIVE INTO 
MANY MORE SMALL FIRMS.
OUR NEW UNIVERSITY FOR INDUSTRY, COLLABORATING WITH THE OPEN 
UNIVERSITY, WILL BRING NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO ADULTS SEEKING TO 
DEVELOP THEIR POTENTIAL.  THIS WILL BRING GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY 
AND EDUCATION TOGETHER TO CREATE A NEW RESOURCE WHOSE REMIT WILL 
BE TO USE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE SKILLS AND EDUCATION. THE 
UNIVERSITY FOR INDUSTRY WILL BE A PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP, 
COMMISSIONING SOFTWARE AND DEVELOPING THE LINKS TO EXTEND 
LIFELONG LEARNING.


GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON EDUCATION

THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON EDUCATION 
AS A SHARE OF NATIONAL INCOME BY THE EQUIVALENT OF MORE THAN 3 
BILLION POUNDS AS SPENDING ON THE BILLS OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
FAILURE HAS RISEN. WE ARE COMMITTED TO REVERSING THIS TREND OF 
SPENDING. OVER THE COURSE OF A 
FIVE-YEAR PARLIAMENT, AS WE CUT THE COSTS OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
FAILURE WE WILL RAISE THE PROPORTION OF NATIONAL INCOME SPENT ON 
EDUCATION.


WE WILL
PROMOTE PERSONAL 
PROSPERITY FOR ALL

- ECONOMIC STABILITY TO PROMOTE INVESTMENT 
- TOUGH INFLATION TARGET, MORTGAGE RATES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE 
- STICK FOR TWO YEARS WITHIN EXISTING SPENDING LIMITS 
- FIVE-YEAR PLEDGE: NO INCREASEIN INCOME TAX RATES
- LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF TEN PENCE STARTING RATE OF INCOME TAX
- EARLY BUDGET TO GET PEOPLE OFF WELFARE AND INTO WORK

THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE IN 18 YEARS CREATED THE TWO LONGEST, 
DEEPEST RECESSIONS THIS CENTURY. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE 
SLOWEST AVERAGE GROWTH RATE OF ANY SIMILAR PERIOD SINCE THE 
SECOND WORLD WAR. THERE HAS BEEN A FUNDAMENTAL FAILURE TO 
TACKLE THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF INFLATION, OF LOW GROWTH AND OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT. THESE ARE: 
 	TOO MUCH ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, WITH WILD SWINGS FROM 
BOOM TO BUST
 	TOO LITTLE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION AND SKILLS, AND IN THE 
APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES
 	TOO FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND JOBS, START NEW BUSINESSES 
OR BECOME SELF-EMPLOYED
 	TOO NARROW AN INDUSTRIAL BASE
 	AND TOO LITTLE SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE IN THE WORKPLACE 
OR ACROSS THE NATION.
BRITAIN CAN DO BETTER. WE MUST BUILD ON THE BRITISH QUALITIES OF 
INVENTIVENESS, CREATIVITY AND ADAPTABILITY. NEW LABOUR'S 
OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE LIVING STANDARDS FOR THE MANY, NOT JUST 
THE FEW. BUSINESS CAN AND MUST SUCCEED IN RAISING PRODUCTIVITY. 
THIS REQUIRES A COMBINATION OF A SKILLED AND EDUCATED WORKFORCE 
WITH INVESTMENT IN THE LATEST TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS, AS THE 
ROUTE TO HIGHER WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT.
AN EXPLICIT OBJECTIVE OF A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL BE TO RAISE THE 
TREND RATE OF GROWTH BY STRENGTHENING OUR WEALTH-CREATING BASE. 
WE WILL NURTURE INVESTMENT IN INDUSTRY, SKILLS, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AND WE WILL ATTACK LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, 
ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. OUR GOAL WILL BE EDUCATIONAL 
AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL.
ECONOMIC STABILITY IS THE ESSENTIAL PLATFORM FOR SUSTAINED GROWTH. 
IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY THE ROUTE TO GROWTH IS STABILITY NOT INFLATION. 
THE PRIORITY MUST BE STABLE, LOW-INFLATION CONDITIONS FOR LONG-
TERM GROWTH. THE ROOT CAUSES OF INFLATION AND LOW GROWTH ARE THE 
SAME - AN ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL BASE THAT REMAINS WEAK. 
GOVERNMENT CANNOT SOLVE ALL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OR END THE 
ECONOMIC CYCLE. BUT BY SPENDING WISELY AND TAXING FAIRLY, 
GOVERNMENT CAN HELP TACKLE THE PROBLEMS. OUR GOALS ARE LOW 
INFLATION, RISING LIVING STANDARDS AND HIGH AND STABLE LEVELS OF 
EMPLOYMENT.


SPENDING AND TAX: NEW LABOUR'S APPROACH

THE MYTH THAT THE SOLUTION TO EVERY PROBLEM IS INCREASED 
SPENDING HAS BEEN COMPREHENSIVELY DISPELLED UNDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES. SPENDING HAS RISEN. BUT MORE SPENDING HAS 
BROUGHT NEITHER GREATER FAIRNESS NOR LESS POVERTY. QUITE THE 
REVERSE - OUR SOCIETY IS MORE DIVIDED THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR 
GENERATIONS. THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC SPENDING IS NO LONGER THE BEST 
MEASURE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT ACTION IN THE PUBLIC 
INTEREST. IT IS WHAT MONEY IS ACTUALLY SPENT ON THAT COUNTS MORE 
THAN HOW MUCH MONEY IS SPENT. 
THE NATIONAL DEBT HAS DOUBLED UNDER JOHN MAJOR. THE PUBLIC 
FINANCES REMAIN WEAK. A NEW LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE 
IMMEDIATE HIGH PRIORITY TO SEEING HOW PUBLIC MONEY CAN BE 
BETTER USED. 
NEW LABOUR WILL BE WISE SPENDERS, NOT BIG SPENDERS. WE WILL 
WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. 
WE WILL ASK ABOUT PUBLIC SPENDING THE FIRST QUESTION THAT A 
MANAGER IN ANY COMPANY WOULD ASK - CAN EXISTING RESOURCES BE 
USED MORE EFFECTIVELY TO MEET OUR PRIORITIES? AND BECAUSE 
EFFICIENCY AND VALUE FOR MONEY ARE CENTRAL, MINISTERS WILL BE 
REQUIRED TO SAVE BEFORE THEY SPEND. 
SAVE TO INVEST IS OUR APPROACH, NOT TAX AND SPEND.  
THE INCREASE IN TAXES UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES IS THE MOST 
DRAMATIC EVIDENCE OF ECONOMIC FAILURE. SINCE 1992 THE TYPICAL 
FAMILY HAS PAID MORE THAN 2,000 POUNDS IN EXTRA TAXES - THE 
BIGGEST TAX HIKE IN PEACETIME HISTORY, BREAKING EVERY PROMISE 
MADE BY JOHN MAJOR AT THE LAST ELECTION. THE TRAGEDY IS THAT THOSE 
HARDEST HIT ARE LEAST ABLE TO PAY. THAT IS WHY WE STRONGLY 
OPPOSED THE IMPOSITION OF VAT ON FUEL: IT WAS LABOUR THAT 
STOPPED THE GOVERNMENT FROM INCREASING VAT ON FUEL TO 17.5 
PER CENT.
TAXATION IS NOT NEUTRAL IN THE WAY IT RAISES REVENUE. HOW AND 
WHAT GOVERNMENTS TAX SENDS CLEAR SIGNALS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC 
ACTIVITIES THEY BELIEVE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED OR DISCOURAGED, AND 
THE VALUES THEY WISH TO ENTRENCH IN SOCIETY. JUST AS, FOR EXAMPLE, 
WORK SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM, 
ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED.
NEW LABOUR WILL ESTABLISH A NEW TRUST ON TAX WITH THE BRITISH 
PEOPLE. THE PROMISES WE MAKE WE WILL KEEP. THE PRINCIPLES THAT 
WILL UNDERPIN OUR TAX POLICY ARE CLEAR: 
 	TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND WORK 
INCENTIVES FOR ALL
 	TO PROMOTE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT
 	AND TO BE FAIR AND BE SEEN TO 
BE FAIR. 
NEW LABOUR IS NOT ABOUT HIGH TAXES ON ORDINARY FAMILIES. IT IS 
ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE AND A FAIR DEAL. 
NEW LABOUR THEREFORE MAKES THE FOLLOWING ECONOMIC PLEDGES.


FAIR TAXES 

THERE WILL BE NO RETURN TO THE PENAL TAX RATES THAT EXISTED UNDER 
BOTH LABOUR AND CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS IN THE 1970S. 
TO ENCOURAGE WORK AND REWARD EFFORT, WE ARE PLEDGED NOT TO 
RAISE THE BASIC OR TOP RATES OF INCOME TAX THROUGHOUT THE NEXT 
PARLIAMENT. 
OUR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE IS A LOWER STARTING RATE OF INCOME TAX OF 
TEN PENCE IN THE POUND. REDUCING THE HIGH MARGINAL RATES AT THE 
BOTTOM END OF THE EARNING SCALE - OFTEN 70 OR 80 PER CENT - IS NOT 
ONLY FAIR BUT DESIRABLE TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYMENT. 
THIS GOAL WILL BENEFIT THE MANY, NOT THE FEW. IT IS IN SHARP 
CONTRAST TO THE TORY GOAL OF ABOLISHING CAPITAL GAINS AND 
INHERITANCE TAX, AT LEAST HALF THE BENEFIT OF WHICH WILL GO TO THE 
RICHEST 5,000 FAMILIES IN THE COUNTRY.  
WE WILL CUT VAT ON FUEL TO FIVE 
PER CENT, THE LOWEST LEVEL ALLOWED. 

WE RENEW OUR PLEDGE NOT TO EXTEND VAT TO FOOD, CHILDREN'S 
CLOTHES, BOOKS AND NEWSPAPERS AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT FARES.  
WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE INTERACTION OF THE TAX AND BENEFITS 
SYSTEMS SO THAT THEY CAN BE STREAMLINED AND MODERNISED, SO AS TO 
FULFIL OUR OBJECTIVES OF PROMOTING WORK INCENTIVES, REDUCING 
POVERTY AND WELFARE DEPENDENCY, AND STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY 
AND FAMILY LIFE.


NO RISKS WITH INFLATION 

WE WILL MATCH THE CURRENT TARGET FOR LOW AND STABLE INFLATION OF 
2.5 PER CENT OR LESS. WE WILL REFORM THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO 
ENSURE THAT DECISION-MAKING ON MONETARY POLICY IS MORE 
EFFECTIVE, OPEN, ACCOUNTABLE AND
FREE FROM SHORT-TERM POLITICAL MANIPULATION.


STRICT RULES FOR GOVERNMENT BORROWING 

WE WILL ENFORCE THE 'GOLDEN RULE' OF PUBLIC SPENDING - OVER THE 
ECONOMIC CYCLE, WE WILL ONLY BORROW TO INVEST AND NOT TO FUND 
CURRENT EXPENDITURE.
WE WILL ENSURE THAT - OVER THE ECONOMIC CYCLE - PUBLIC DEBT AS A 
PROPORTION OF NATIONAL INCOME IS AT A STABLE AND PRUDENT LEVEL.  


STICK TO PLANNED PUBLIC SPENDING ALLOCATIONS FOR THE FIRST TWO 
YEARS OF OFFICE 

OUR DECISIONS HAVE NOT BEEN TAKEN LIGHTLY. THEY ARE A RECOGNITION 
OF CONSERVATIVE MISMANAGEMENT OF THE PUBLIC FINANCES. FOR THE 
NEXT TWO YEARS LABOUR WILL WORK WITHIN THE DEPARTMENTAL 
CEILINGS FOR SPENDING ALREADY ANNOUNCED. WE WILL RESIST 
UNREASONABLE DEMANDS ON THE PUBLIC PURSE, INCLUDING ANY 
UNREASONABLE PUBLIC SECTOR PAY DEMANDS.


SWITCH SPENDING FROM ECONOMIC FAILURE TO INVESTMENT

WE WILL CONDUCT A CENTRAL SPENDING REVIEW AND DEPARTMENTAL 
REVIEWS TO ASSESS HOW TO USE RESOURCES BETTER, WHILE ROOTING OUT 
WASTE AND INEFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC SPENDING.
LABOUR PRIORITIES IN PUBLIC SPENDING ARE DIFFERENT FROM TORY 
PRIORITIES. 


TAX REFORM TO PROMOTE SAVING AND INVESTMENT  

WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW INDIVIDUAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND EXTEND 
THE PRINCIPLE OF TESSAS AND PEPS TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM SAVING. 
WE WILL REVIEW THE CORPORATE AND CAPITAL GAINS TAX REGIMES TO SEE 
HOW THE TAX SYSTEM CAN PROMOTE GREATER LONG-TERM INVESTMENT. 


LABOUR'S WELFARE-TO-WORK BUDGET

WE WILL INTRODUCE A BUDGET WITHIN TWO MONTHS AFTER THE ELECTION 
TO BEGIN THE TASK OF EQUIPPING THE BRITISH ECONOMY AND 
REFORMING THE WELFARE STATE TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE LONG-
TERM UNEMPLOYED BACK TO WORK. THIS WELFARE-TO-WORK 
PROGRAMME WILL BE FUNDED BY A WINDFALL LEVY ON THE EXCESS 
PROFITS OF THE PRIVATISED UTILITIES, INTRODUCED IN THIS BUDGET AFTER 
WE HAVE CONSULTED THE REGULATORS.


WE WILL
HELP CREATE SUCCESSFUL 
AND PROFITABLE BUSINESSES

- BACKING BUSINESS: SKILLS, INFRASTRUCTURE, NEW MARKETS  
- GAINS FOR CONSUMERS WITH TOUGH COMPETITION LAW
- NEW MEASURES TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES
- NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE TO TACKLE
LOW PAY
- BOOST LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCIES
- A STRONG AND EFFECTIVE VOICE IN EUROPE


NEW LABOUR OFFERS BUSINESS A NEW DEAL FOR THE FUTURE. WE WILL 
LEAVE INTACT THE MAIN CHANGES OF THE 1980S IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 
AND ENTERPRISE. WE SEE HEALTHY PROFITS AS AN ESSENTIAL MOTOR OF A 
DYNAMIC MARKET ECONOMY, AND BELIEVE THEY DEPEND ON QUALITY 
PRODUCTS, INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEURS AND SKILLED EMPLOYEES. WE 
WILL BUILD A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH BUSINESS TO IMPROVE THE 
COMPETITIVENESS OF BRITISH INDUSTRY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, LEADING 
TO FASTER GROWTH. 
MANY OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY ARE STILL WEAK. 
LOW PAY AND LOW SKILLS GO TOGETHER: INSECURITY IS THE 
CONSEQUENCE OF ECONOMIC INSTABILITY; THE ABSENCE OF QUALITY JOBS 
IS A PRODUCT OF THE WEAKNESS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE; WE SUFFER 
FROM BOTH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND SKILLS SHORTAGES. THERE IS NO 
FUTURE FOR BRITAIN AS A LOW WAGE ECONOMY: WE CANNOT COMPETE 
ON WAGES WITH COUNTRIES PAYING A TENTH OR A HUNDREDTH OF BRITISH 
WAGES. 
WE NEED TO WIN ON HIGHER QUALITY, SKILL, INNOVATION AND 
RELIABILITY. WITH LABOUR, BRITISH AND INWARD INVESTORS WILL FIND 
THIS COUNTRY AN ATTRACTIVE AND PROFITABLE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS.
NEW LABOUR BELIEVES IN A FLEXIBLE LABOUR MARKET THAT SERVES 
EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES ALIKE. BUT FLEXIBILITY ALONE IS NOT 
ENOUGH. WE NEED 'FLEXIBILITY PLUS':
	PLUS HIGHER SKILLS AND HIGHER STANDARDS IN OUR SCHOOLS 
AND COLLEGES
	PLUS POLICIES TO ENSURE ECONOMIC STABILITY
	PLUS PARTNERSHIP WITH BUSINESS TO RAISE INVESTMENT IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE, SCIENCE AND RESEARCH AND TO
	BACK SMALL FIRMS
	PLUS NEW LEADERSHIP FROM BRITAIN TO REFORM EUROPE, IN 
PLACE OF THE CURRENT POLICY OF DRIFT AND DISENGAGEMENT FROM OUR 
LARGEST MARKET 
	PLUS GUARANTEEING BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE SINGLE 
MARKET - INDEED OPENING UP FURTHER MARKETS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE 
THE EU - HELPING MAKE BRITAIN AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS
	PLUS MINIMUM STANDARDS OF FAIR TREATMENT, INCLUDING A 
NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE
	PLUS AN IMAGINATIVE WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAMME TO PUT 
THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED BACK TO WORK AND TO CUT SOCIAL 
SECURITY COSTS.


A REFORMED AND TOUGHER COMPETITION LAW  

COMPETITIVENESS ABROAD MUST BEGIN WITH COMPETITION AT HOME. 
EFFECTIVE COMPETITION CAN BRING VALUE AND QUALITY TO CONSUMERS. 
AS AN EARLY PRIORITY WE WILL REFORM BRITAIN'S COMPETITION LAW. 
WE WILL ADOPT A TOUGH 'PROHIBITIVE' APPROACH TO DETER ANTI-
COMPETITIVE PRACTICES AND ABUSES OF MARKET POWER. 
IN THE UTILITY INDUSTRIES WE WILL PROMOTE COMPETITION WHEREVER 
POSSIBLE. WHERE COMPETITION IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINE, FOR 
EXAMPLE IN THE WATER INDUSTRY WHICH HAS A POOR ENVIRONMENTAL 
RECORD AND HAS IN MOST CASES BEEN A TAX-FREE ZONE, WE WILL 
PURSUE TOUGH, EFFICIENT REGULATION IN THE INTERESTS OF CUSTOMERS, 
AND, IN THE CASE OF WATER, IN THE INTERESTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT AS 
WELL. WE RECOGNISE THE NEED FOR OPEN AND PREDICTABLE REGULATION 
WHICH IS FAIR BOTH TO CONSUMERS AND TO SHAREHOLDERS AND AT THE 
SAME TIME PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR MANAGERS TO INNOVATE AND 
IMPROVE EFFICIENCY. 


REINVIGORATE THE PRIVATE FINANCE INITIATIVE  

BRITAIN'S INFRASTRUCTURE IS DANGEROUSLY RUN DOWN: PARTS OF OUR 
ROAD AND RAIL NETWORK ARE SERIOUSLY NEGLECTED, AND ALL TOO OFTEN 
OUR URBAN ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO DETERIORATE.  
LABOUR PIONEERED THE IDEA OF PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. IT IS 
LABOUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHICH HAVE DONE MOST TO CREATE THESE 
PARTNERSHIPS AT LOCAL LEVEL.
A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE 
PLAGUED THE PFI AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. WE WILL SET PRIORITIES BETWEEN 
PROJECTS, SAVING TIME AND EXPENSE; WE WILL SEEK A REALISTIC 
ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTNERS TO A PROJECT; AND WE WILL 
ENSURE THAT BEST PRACTICE IS SPREAD THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT. WE 
WILL AIM TO SIMPLIFY AND SPEED UP THE PLANNING PROCESS FOR MAJOR 
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OF VITAL NATIONAL INTEREST. 
WE WILL ENSURE THAT SELF-FINANCING COMMERCIAL ORGANISATIONS 
WITHIN THE PUBLIC SECTOR - THE POST OFFICE IS A PRIME EXAMPLE - 
ARE GIVEN GREATER COMMERCIAL FREEDOM TO MAKE THE MOST OF NEW 
OPPORTUNITIES.


BACKING SMALL BUSINESS 

THE NUMBER OF SMALL EMPLOYERS HAS DECLINED BY HALF A MILLION 
SINCE 1990.  SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WILL HAVE A MAJOR ROLE 
IN OUR PLANS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE WILL CUT UNNECESSARY RED 
TAPE; PROVIDE FOR STATUTORY INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENT OF DEBTS; 
IMPROVE SUPPORT FOR HIGH-TECH START-UPS; IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND 
RELEVANCE OF ADVICE AND TRAINING THROUGH A REFORMED BUSINESS 
LINKS NETWORK AND THE UNIVERSITY FOR INDUSTRY; AND ASSIST FIRMS 
TO ENTER OVERSEAS MARKETS MORE EFFECTIVELY. 


LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH  

PROSPERITY NEEDS TO BE BUILT FROM THE BOTTOM UP. WE WILL 
ESTABLISH ONE-STOP REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TO CO-ORDINATE 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, HELP SMALL BUSINESS AND 
ENCOURAGE INWARD INVESTMENT. MANY REGIONS ARE ALREADY TAKING 
INFORMAL STEPS TO THIS END AND THEY WILL BE SUPPORTED.


STRENGTHEN OUR CAPABILITY IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN   
THE UK MUST BE POSITIVELY COMMITTED TO THE GLOBAL PURSUIT OF 
NEW KNOWLEDGE, WITH A STRONG SCIENCE BASE IN OUR UNIVERSITIES 
AND CENTRES OF EXCELLENCE LEADING THE WORLD. THE DEARING 
COMMITTEE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE HIGH-
QUALITY STANDARDS IN SCIENCE TEACHING AND RESEARCH THROUGHOUT 
UK HIGHER EDUCATION. WE SUPPORT A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH 
BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AND BUSINESS, SPREADING THE USE OF NEW 
TECHNOLOGY AND GOOD DESIGN, AND EXPLOITING OUR OWN INVENTIONS 
TO BOOST BUSINESS IN THE UK.


PROMOTING NEW GREEN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESSES  

THERE IS HUGE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP BRITAIN'S ENVIRONMENTAL 
TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES TO CREATE JOBS, WIN EXPORTS AND PROTECT THE 
ENVIRONMENT.
EFFECTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT IS AN INCREASINGLY 
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF MODERN BUSINESS PRACTICE. WE SUPPORT A 
MAJOR PUSH TO PROMOTE ENERGY CONSERVATION - PARTICULARLY BY THE 
PROMOTION OF HOME ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCHEMES, LINKED TO OUR 
ENVIRONMENT TASKFORCE FOR THE UNDER-25S. WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
AN ENERGY POLICY DESIGNED TO PROMOTE CLEANER, MORE EFFICIENT 
ENERGY USE AND PRODUCTION, INCLUDING A NEW AND STRONG DRIVE TO 
DEVELOP RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES SUCH AS SOLAR AND WIND 
ENERGY, AND COMBINED HEAT AND POWER. WE SEE NO ECONOMIC 
CASE FOR THE BUILDING OF ANY NEW NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS.


KEY ELEMENTS OF THE 1980S TRADE UNION REFORMS TO STAY 
THERE MUST BE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AT WORK, 
INCLUDING A MINIMUM WAGE, WITHIN A FLEXIBLE LABOUR MARKET. WE 
NEED A SENSIBLE BALANCE IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LAW - RIGHTS AND 
DUTIES GO TOGETHER. 
THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE TRADE UNION LEGISLATION OF THE 1980S WILL 
STAY - ON BALLOTS, PICKETING AND INDUSTRIAL ACTION. PEOPLE SHOULD 
BE FREE TO JOIN OR NOT TO JOIN A UNION. WHERE THEY DO DECIDE TO 
JOIN, AND WHERE A MAJORITY OF THE RELEVANT WORKFORCE VOTE IN A 
BALLOT FOR THE UNION TO REPRESENT THEM, THE UNION SHOULD BE 
RECOGNISED. THIS PROMOTES STABLE AND ORDERLY INDUSTRIAL 
RELATIONS.  THERE WILL BE FULL CONSULTATION ON THE MOST EFFECTIVE 
MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS PROPOSAL.


PARTNERSHIP AT WORK  

THE BEST COMPANIES RECOGNISE THEIR EMPLOYEES AS PARTNERS IN THE 
ENTERPRISE. EMPLOYEES WHOSE CONDITIONS ARE GOOD ARE MORE 
COMMITTED TO THEIR COMPANIES AND ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE. MANY 
UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS ARE EMBRACING PARTNERSHIP IN PLACE OF 
CONFLICT. GOVERNMENT SHOULD WELCOME THIS.
WE ARE KEEN TO ENCOURAGE A VARIETY OF FORMS OF PARTNERSHIP AND 
ENTERPRISE, SPREADING OWNERSHIP AND ENCOURAGING MORE 
EMPLOYEES TO BECOME OWNERS THROUGH EMPLOYEE SHARE 
OWNERSHIP PLANS AND 
CO-OPERATIVES. WE SUPPORT TOO THE SOCIAL CHAPTER OF THE EU, BUT 
WILL DEPLOY OUR INFLUENCE IN EUROPE TO ENSURE THAT IT DEVELOPS SO 
AS TO  PROMOTE EMPLOYABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS, NOT 
INFLEXIBILITY.


A SENSIBLY SET NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE 

THERE SHOULD BE A STATUTORY LEVEL BENEATH WHICH PAY SHOULD NOT 
FALL - WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE DECIDED NOT ON THE BASIS OF A RIGID 
FORMULA BUT ACCORDING TO THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TIME 
AND WITH THE ADVICE OF AN INDEPENDENT LOW PAY COMMISSION, 
WHOSE MEMBERSHIP
WILL INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF EMPLOYERS, INCLUDING SMALL 
BUSINESS, AND EMPLOYEES. 
EVERY MODERN INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY HAS A MINIMUM WAGE, 
INCLUDING THE US AND JAPAN. BRITAIN USED TO HAVE MINIMUM 
WAGES THROUGH THE WAGES COUNCILS. INTRODUCED SENSIBLY, THE 
MINIMUM WAGE WILL REMOVE THE WORST EXCESSES OF LOW PAY (AND 
BE OF PARTICULAR BENEFIT TO WOMEN), WHILE CUTTING SOME OF THE 
MASSIVE 
4 BILLION POUNDS BENEFITS BILL BY WHICH THE TAXPAYER SUBSIDISES 
COMPANIES THAT PAY VERY LOW WAGES.


WE WILL
GET THE UNEMPLOYED 
FROM WELFARE TO WORK


- STOP THE GROWTH OF AN 'UNDERCLASS' IN BRITAIN
- 250,000 YOUNG UNEMPLOYED OFF BENEFIT AND INTO WORK 
- TAX CUTS FOR EMPLOYERS WHO CREATE NEW JOBS FOR THE LONG-TERM 
UNEMPLOYED
- EFFECTIVE HELP FOR LONE PARENTS


THERE ARE OVER ONE MILLION FEWER JOBS IN BRITAIN THAN IN 1990. 
ONE IN FIVE FAMILIES HAS NO ONE WORKING. ONE MILLION SINGLE 
MOTHERS ARE TRAPPED ON BENEFITS. THERE IS A WIDER GAP BETWEEN 
RICH AND POOR THAN FOR GENERATIONS. 
WE ARE DETERMINED NOT TO CONTINUE DOWN THE ROAD OF A PERMANENT
HAVE-NOT CLASS, UNEMPLOYED AND DISAFFECTED FROM SOCIETY. OUR 
LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE IS HIGH AND STABLE LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT. 
THIS IS THE TRUE MEANING OF A STAKEHOLDER ECONOMY - WHERE 
EVERYONE HAS A STAKE IN SOCIETY AND OWES RESPONSIBILITIES TO IT.
THE BEST WAY TO TACKLE POVERTY IS TO HELP PEOPLE INTO JOBS - REAL 
JOBS. THE UNEMPLOYED HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE UP THE 
OPPORTUNITY OF TRAINING PLACES OR WORK, BUT THESE MUST BE REAL 
OPPORTUNITIES. THE GOVERNMENT'S WORKFARE PROPOSALS - WITH A 
SUCCESS RATE OF ONE IN TEN - FAIL THIS TEST. 
LABOUR'S WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAMME WILL ATTACK UNEMPLOYMENT 
AND BREAK THE SPIRAL OF ESCALATING SPENDING ON SOCIAL SECURITY. A 
ONE-OFF WINDFALL LEVY ON THE EXCESS PROFITS OF THE PRIVATISED 
UTILITIES WILL FUND OUR AMBITIOUS PROGRAMME. 


EVERY YOUNG PERSON UNEMPLOYED FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS IN A 
JOB OR TRAINING  

WE WILL GIVE 250,000 UNDER-25S OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORK, 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING. FOUR OPTIONS WILL BE ON OFFER, EACH 
INVOLVING DAY-RELEASE EDUCATION OR TRAINING LEADING TO A 
QUALIFICATION: 
	PRIVATE-SECTOR JOB: EMPLOYERS WILL BE OFFERED A 60 POUND-
A-WEEK REBATE FOR SIX MONTHS
	WORK WITH A NON-PROFIT VOLUNTARY SECTOR EMPLOYER, 
PAYING A WEEKLY WAGE, EQUIVALENT TO BENEFIT PLUS A FIXED SUM FOR 
SIX MONTHS
	FULL-TIME STUDY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITHOUT QUALIFICATIONS 
ON AN APPROVED COURSE
	A JOB WITH THE ENVIRONMENT TASKFORCE, LINKED TO LABOUR'S 
CITIZENS' SERVICE PROGRAMME.
RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES MUST GO HAND IN HAND, WITHOUT A FIFTH 
OPTION OF LIFE ON FULL BENEFIT. 


EVERY 16 AND 17 YEAR-OLD ON THE ROAD TO A PROPER QUALIFICATION BY 
THE YEAR 2000

NEARLY A THIRD OF YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT ACHIEVE AN NVQ LEVEL TWO 
QUALIFICATION BY AGE 19. ALL YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BE OFFERED PART-
TIME OR FULL-TIME EDUCATION AFTER THE AGE OF 16. ANY UNDER-18 
YEAR-OLD IN A JOB WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO STUDY ON AN APPROVED 
COURSE FOR QUALIFICATIONS AT COLLEGE. WE WILL REPLACE THE FAILED 
YOUTH TRAINING SCHEME WITH OUR NEW TARGET 2000 PROGRAMME, 
OFFERING YOUNG PEOPLE HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING. 


ACTION ON LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT   

NEW PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS, FULLY 
INVOLVING LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR, WILL ATTACK 
LONG-TERM JOBLESSNESS. WE WILL ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO TAKE ON 
THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED UNEMPLOYMENT FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS 
WITH A 75 POUND-A-WEEK TAX REBATE PAID FOR SIX MONTHS, FINANCED 
BY THE WINDFALL LEVY. OUR PROGRAMME FOR THE PHASED RELEASE OF 
PAST RECEIPTS FROM COUNCIL HOUSE SALES WILL PROVIDE NEW JOBS IN 
THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.


LONE PARENTS INTO WORK  

TODAY THE MAIN CONNECTION BETWEEN UNEMPLOYED LONE PARENTS 
AND THE STATE IS THEIR BENEFITS. MOST LONE PARENTS WANT TO WORK, 
BUT ARE GIVEN NO HELP TO FIND IT. NEW LABOUR HAS A POSITIVE 
POLICY. ONCE THE YOUNGEST CHILD IS IN THE SECOND TERM OF FULL-TIME 
SCHOOL, LONE PARENTS WILL BE OFFERED ADVICE BY A PROACTIVE 
EMPLOYMENT SERVICE TO DEVELOP A PACKAGE OF JOB SEARCH, TRAINING 
AND AFTER-SCHOOL CARE TO HELP THEM OFF BENEFIT. 


CUSTOMISED, PERSONALISED SERVICES  

WE FAVOUR INITIATIVES WITH NEW COMBINATIONS OF AVAILABLE 
BENEFITS TO SUIT INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IN NEW AND INNOVATIVE 
'EMPLOYMENT ZONES', PERSONAL JOB ACCOUNTS WILL COMBINE 
MONEY CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR BENEFITS AND TRAINING, TO OFFER THE 
UNEMPLOYED NEW OPTIONS - LEADING TO WORK AND INDEPENDENCE. 
WE WILL CO-ORDINATE BENEFITS, EMPLOYMENT AND CAREER SERVICES, 
AND UTILISE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY AND 
EFFICIENCY.


FRAUD 

JUST AS WE OWE IT TO THE TAXPAYER TO CRACK DOWN ON TAX 
AVOIDANCE, SO WE MUST CRACK DOWN ON DISHONESTY IN THE BENEFIT 
SYSTEM. WE WILL START WITH A CLAMPDOWN ON HOUSING BENEFIT 
FRAUD, ESTIMATED TO COST 2 BILLION POUNDS A YEAR, AND WILL 
MAINTAIN ACTION AGAINST BENEFIT FRAUD OF ALL KINDS.


WE WILL
SAVE THE NHS

- 100,000 PEOPLE OFF WAITING LISTS
- END THE TORY INTERNAL MARKET
- END WAITING FOR CANCER SURGERY
- TOUGH QUALITY TARGETS FOR HOSPITALS 
- INDEPENDENT FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY
- NEW PUBLIC HEALTH DRIVE
- RAISE SPENDING IN REAL TERMS EVERY YEAR - AND SPEND THE MONEY 
ON PATIENTS NOT BUREAUCRACY

LABOUR CREATED THE NHS 

50 YEARS AGO. IT IS UNDER THREAT FROM THE CONSERVATIVES. WE WANT 
TO SAVE AND MODERNISE THE NHS.
BUT IF THE CONSERVATIVES ARE ELECTED AGAIN THERE MAY WELL NOT BE 
AN NHS IN FIVE YEARS' TIME - NEITHER NATIONAL NOR 
COMPREHENSIVE. LABOUR COMMITS ITSELF ANEW TO THE HISTORIC 
PRINCIPLE: THAT IF YOU ARE ILL OR INJURED THERE WILL BE A NATIONAL 
HEALTH SERVICE THERE TO HELP; AND ACCESS TO IT WILL BE BASED ON 
NEED AND NEED ALONE - NOT ON YOUR ABILITY TO PAY, OR ON WHO 
YOUR GP HAPPENS TO BE OR ON WHERE YOU LIVE.
IN 1990 THE CONSERVATIVES IMPOSED ON THE NHS A COMPLEX 
INTERNAL MARKET OF HOSPITALS COMPETING TO WIN CONTRACTS FROM 
HEALTH AUTHORITIES AND FUNDHOLDING GPS. THE RESULT IS AN NHS 
STRANGLED BY COSTLY RED TAPE, WITH EVERY INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION 
THE SUBJECT OF A SEPARATE INVOICE. AFTER SIX YEARS, BUREAUCRACY 
SWALLOWS AN EXTRA 1.5 BILLION POUNDS PER YEAR; THERE ARE 20,000 
MORE MANAGERS AND 50,000 FEWER NURSES ON THE WARDS; AND 
MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE ARE ON WAITING LISTS.  THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO MEET EVEN ITS OWN HEALTH 
TARGETS.
THERE CAN BE NO RETURN TO TOP-DOWN MANAGEMENT, BUT LABOUR 
WILL END THE CONSERVATIVES' INTERNAL MARKET IN HEALTHCARE. THE 
PLANNING AND PROVISION OF CARE ARE NECESSARY AND DISTINCT 
FUNCTIONS, AND WILL REMAIN SO. BUT UNDER THE TORIES, THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF PURCHASING CARE HAVE UNDERMINED 
PROVISION AND THE MARKET SYSTEM HAS DISTORTED CLINICAL PRIORITIES. 
LABOUR WILL CUT COSTS BY REMOVING THE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSES OF 
THE INTERNAL MARKET.
THE SAVINGS ACHIEVED WILL GO ON DIRECT CARE FOR PATIENTS. AS A 
START, THE FIRST 100 MILLION POUNDS SAVED WILL TREAT AN EXTRA 
100,000 PATIENTS. WE WILL END WAITING FOR CANCER SURGERY, 
THEREBY HELPING THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WAITING FOR BREAST CANCER 
TREATMENT.


PRIMARY CARE WILL PLAY A LEAD ROLE  

IN RECENT YEARS, GPS HAVE GAINED POWER ON BEHALF OF THEIR 
PATIENTS IN A CHANGED RELATIONSHIP WITH CONSULTANTS, AND WE 
SUPPORT THIS. BUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF GP FUNDHOLDING HAS ALSO 
BROUGHT DISADVANTAGES. DECISION-MAKING HAS BEEN FRAGMENTED. 
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS HAVE GROWN. AND A TWO-TIER SERVICE HAS 
RESULTED. 
LABOUR WILL RETAIN THE LEAD ROLE FOR PRIMARY CARE BUT REMOVE THE 
DISADVANTAGES THAT HAVE COME FROM THE PRESENT SYSTEM. GPS AND 
NURSES WILL TAKE THE LEAD IN COMBINING TOGETHER LOCALLY TO PLAN 
LOCAL HEALTH SERVICES MORE EFFICIENTLY FOR ALL THE PATIENTS IN THEIR 
AREA. THIS WILL ENABLE ALL GPS IN AN AREA TO BRING THEIR COMBINED 
STRENGTH TO BEAR UPON INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS TO SECURE HIGHER 
STANDARDS OF PATIENT PROVISION. IN MAKING THIS CHANGE, WE WILL 
BUILD ON THE EXISTING COLLABORATIVE SCHEMES WHICH ALREADY SERVE 
14 MILLION PEOPLE. 
THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF YEAR-ON-YEAR CONTRACTS IS COSTLY AND 
UNSTABLE. WE WILL INTRODUCE THREE- TO FIVE-YEAR AGREEMENTS 
BETWEEN THE LOCAL PRIMARY CARE TEAMS AND HOSPITALS. HOSPITALS 
WILL THEN BE BETTER ABLE TO PLAN WORK AT FULL CAPACITY AND CO-
OPERATE TO ENHANCE PATIENT SERVICES.


HIGHER-QUALITY SERVICES FOR PATIENTS

HOSPITALS WILL RETAIN THEIR AUTONOMY OVER DAY-TO-DAY 
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS, BUT, AS PART OF THE NHS, THEY WILL BE 
REQUIRED TO MEET HIGH-QUALITY STANDARDS IN THE PROVISION OF CARE. 
MANAGEMENT WILL BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR PERFORMANCE LEVELS. 
BOARDS WILL BECOME MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE  LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. 
A NEW PATIENTS' CHARTER WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE QUALITY AND 
SUCCESS OF TREATMENT. THE TORIES' SO-CALLED  'EFFICIENCY INDEX' 
COUNTS THE NUMBER OF PATIENT 'EPISODES', NOT THE QUALITY OR 
SUCCESS OF TREATMENT. WITH LABOUR, THE MEASURE WILL BE QUALITY 
OF OUTCOME, ITSELF AN INCENTIVE FOR EFFECTIVENESS. AS PART OF OUR 
CONCERN TO ENSURE QUALITY, WE WILL WORK TOWARDS THE ELIMINATION 
OF MIXED-SEX WARDS.
HEALTH AUTHORITIES WILL BECOME THE GUARDIANS OF HIGH STANDARDS. 
THEY WILL MONITOR SERVICES, SPREAD BEST PRACTICE AND ENSURE 
RISING STANDARDS OF CARE. 
THE TORY ATTEMPT TO USE PRIVATE MONEY TO BUILD HOSPITALS HAS 
FAILED TO DELIVER. LABOUR WILL OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE 
PLAGUED THE PRIVATE FINANCE INITIATIVE, END THE DELAYS, SORT OUT 
THE CONFUSION AND DEVELOP NEW FORMS OF PUBLIC/PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIP THAT WORK BETTER AND PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE NHS. 
LABOUR IS OPPOSED TO THE PRIVATISATION OF CLINICAL SERVICES WHICH 
IS BEING ACTIVELY PROMOTED BY THE CONSERVATIVES.
LABOUR WILL PROMOTE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN TELEMEDICINE - 
BRINGING EXPERT ADVICE FROM REGIONAL CENTRES OF EXCELLENCE TO 
NEIGHBOURHOOD LEVEL USING NEW TECHNOLOGY.


GOOD HEALTH 

A NEW MINISTER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WILL ATTACK THE ROOT CAUSES OF ILL 
HEALTH, AND SO IMPROVE LIVES AND SAVE THE NHS MONEY. LABOUR 
WILL SET NEW GOALS FOR IMPROVING THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE NATION 
WHICH RECOGNISE THE IMPACT THAT POVERTY, POOR HOUSING, 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND A POLLUTED ENVIRONMENT HAVE ON HEALTH.
SMOKING IS THE GREATEST SINGLE CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE ILLNESS AND 
PREMATURE DEATH IN THE UK. WE WILL THEREFORE BAN TOBACCO 
ADVERTISING. 
LABOUR WILL ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY. 
THE 3.5 BILLION POUNDS BSE CRISIS AND THE 
E. COLI OUTBREAK WHICH RESULTED IN SERIOUS LOSS OF LIFE, HAVE MADE 
UNANSWERABLE THE CASE FOR THE INDEPENDENT AGENCY WE HAVE 
PROPOSED. 


NHS SPENDING

THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE WASTED SPENDING ON THE NHS. WE WILL 
DO BETTER. WE WILL RAISE SPENDING ON THE NHS IN REAL TERMS EVERY 
YEAR AND PUT THE MONEY TOWARDS PATIENT CARE. AND A GREATER 
PROPORTION OF EVERY POUND SPENT WILL GO ON PATIENT CARE NOT 
BUREAUCRACY.


AN NHS FOR THE FUTURE

THE NHS REQUIRES CONTINUITY AS WELL AS CHANGE, OR THE SYSTEM 
CANNOT COPE. THERE MUST BE PILOTS TO ENSURE THAT CHANGE WORKS. 
AND THERE MUST BE FLEXIBILITY, NOT RIGID PRESCRIPTION, IF 
INNOVATION IS TO FLOURISH.   
OUR FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE IS SIMPLE BUT HUGELY IMPORTANT: TO 
RESTORE THE NHS AS A PUBLIC SERVICE WORKING 
CO-OPERATIVELY FOR PATIENTS, NOT A COMMERCIAL BUSINESS DRIVEN BY 
COMPETITION.


WE WILL
BE TOUGH ON CRIME AND 
TOUGH ON THE CAUSES 
OF CRIME


- FAST-TRACK PUNISHMENT FOR PERSISTENT YOUNG OFFENDERS
- REFORM CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE TO CONVICT MORE CRIMINALS
- POLICE ON THE BEAT NOT PUSHING PAPER
- CRACKDOWN ON PETTY CRIMES AND NEIGHBOURHOOD DISORDER
- FRESH PARLIAMENTARY VOTE TO BAN ALL HANDGUNS

UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES, CRIME HAS DOUBLED AND MANY MORE 
CRIMINALS GET AWAY WITH THEIR CRIMES: THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
CONVICTED HAS FALLEN BY A THIRD, WITH ONLY ONE CRIME IN 50 LEADING 
TO A CONVICTION. THIS IS THE WORST RECORD 
OF ANY GOVERNMENT SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR - AND FOR 
ENGLAND AND WALES THE WORST RECORD OF ANY MAJOR INDUSTRIALISED 
COUNTRY. LAST YEAR ALONE VIOLENT CRIME ROSE 11 PER CENT.
WE PROPOSE A NEW APPROACH TO LAW AND ORDER: TOUGH ON CRIME 
AND TOUGH ON THE CAUSES OF CRIME. WE INSIST ON INDIVIDUAL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CRIME, AND WILL ATTACK THE CAUSES OF CRIME BY 
OUR MEASURES TO RELIEVE SOCIAL DEPRIVATION. 
THE POLICE HAVE OUR STRONG SUPPORT. THEY ARE IN THE FRONT LINE OF 
THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME AND DISORDER. THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE 
BROKEN THEIR 1992 GENERAL ELECTION PLEDGE TO PROVIDE AN EXTRA 
1,000 POLICE OFFICERS. WE WILL RELIEVE THE POLICE OF UNNECESSARY 
BUREAUCRATIC BURDENS TO GET MORE OFFICERS BACK ON THE BEAT.


YOUTH CRIME 

YOUTH CRIME AND DISORDER HAVE RISEN SHARPLY, BUT VERY FEW 
YOUNG OFFENDERS END UP IN COURT, AND WHEN THEY DO HALF ARE LET 
OFF WITH ANOTHER WARNING. YOUNG OFFENDERS ACCOUNT FOR SEVEN 
MILLION CRIMES A YEAR. 
FAR TOO OFTEN YOUNG CRIMINALS OFFEND AGAIN AND AGAIN WHILE 
WAITING MONTHS FOR A COURT HEARING. WE WILL HALVE THE TIME IT 
TAKES TO GET PERSISTENT YOUNG OFFENDERS FROM ARREST TO SENTENCING; 
REPLACE WIDESPREAD REPEAT CAUTIONS WITH A SINGLE FINAL WARNING; 
BRING TOGETHER YOUTH OFFENDER TEAMS IN EVERY AREA; AND 
STREAMLINE THE SYSTEM OF YOUTH COURTS TO MAKE IT FAR MORE 
EFFECTIVE. 
NEW PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY ORDERS WILL MAKE PARENTS FACE UP TO 
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S MISBEHAVIOUR.


CONVICTION AND SENTENCING 

THE JOB OF THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE IS TO PROSECUTE 
CRIMINALS EFFECTIVELY. THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THE CPS IS 
OVER-CENTRALISED, BUREAUCRATIC AND INEFFICIENT, WITH CASES TOO 
OFTEN DROPPED, DELAYED, OR DOWNGRADED TO LESSER OFFENCES. 
LABOUR WILL DECENTRALISE THE CPS, WITH LOCAL CROWN PROSECUTORS 
CO-OPERATING MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH LOCAL POLICE FORCES.
WE WILL IMPLEMENT AN EFFECTIVE SENTENCING SYSTEM FOR ALL THE 
MAIN OFFENCES TO ENSURE GREATER CONSISTENCY AND STRICTER 
PUNISHMENT FOR SERIOUS REPEAT OFFENDERS. THE COURTS WILL HAVE TO 
SPELL OUT WHAT EACH SENTENCE REALLY MEANS IN PRACTICE. THE COURT 
OF APPEAL WILL HAVE A DUTY TO LAY DOWN SENTENCING GUIDELINES FOR 
ALL THE MAIN OFFENCES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S POWER TO APPEAL 
UNDULY LENIENT SENTENCES WILL BE EXTENDED.
THE PRISON SERVICE NOW FACES SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. WE 
WILL AUDIT THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE, TAKE PROPER MINISTERIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SERVICE, AND SEEK TO ENSURE THAT PRISON 
REGIMES ARE CONSTRUCTIVE AND REQUIRE INMATES TO FACE UP TO THEIR 
OFFENDING BEHAVIOUR.


DISORDER 

THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE FORGOTTEN THE 'ORDER' PART OF 'LAW AND 
ORDER'. WE WILL TACKLE THE UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF ANTI-SOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR AND CRIME ON OUR STREETS. OUR 'ZERO TOLERANCE' 
APPROACH WILL ENSURE THAT PETTY CRIMINALITY AMONG YOUNG 
OFFENDERS IS SERIOUSLY ADDRESSED.
COMMUNITY SAFETY ORDERS WILL DEAL WITH THREATENING AND 
DISRUPTIVE CRIMINAL NEIGHBOURS. LABOUR HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN 
PROPOSING ACTION TO TACKLE THE PROBLEMS OF STALKING AND DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE.
CHILD PROTECTION ORDERS WILL DEAL WITH YOUNG CHILDREN SUFFERING 
NEGLECT BY PARENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE LEFT OUT ON THEIR OWN FAR TOO 
LATE AT NIGHT. 
BRITAIN IS A MULTIRACIAL AND MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY. ALL ITS MEMBERS 
MUST HAVE THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW. WE WILL CREATE A NEW 
OFFENCE OF RACIAL HARASSMENT AND A NEW CRIME OF RACIALLY 
MOTIVATED VIOLENCE TO PROTECT ETHNIC MINORITIES FROM INTIMIDATION.


DRUGS 

THE VICIOUS CIRCLE OF DRUGS AND CRIME WRECKS LIVES AND THREATENS 
COMMUNITIES. LABOUR WILL APPOINT AN ANTI-DRUGS SUPREMO TO CO-
ORDINATE OUR BATTLE AGAINST DRUGS ACROSS ALL GOVERNMENT 
DEPARTMENTS. THE 'DRUG CZAR' WILL BE A SYMBOL OF OUR 
COMMITMENT TO TACKLE THE MODERN MENACE OF DRUGS IN OUR 
COMMUNITIES.
WE WILL PILOT THE USE OF COMPULSORY DRUG TESTING AND TREATMENT 
ORDERS FOR OFFENDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE LINK BETWEEN DRUG 
ADDICTION AND CRIME IS BROKEN. THIS WILL BE PAID FOR BY BRINGING 
REMAND DELAYS DOWN TO THE NATIONAL TARGETS.
WE WILL ATTACK THE DRUG PROBLEM IN PRISONS. IN ADDITION TO 
RANDOM DRUG TESTING OF ALL PRISONERS WE WILL AIM FOR A VOLUNTARY 
TESTING UNIT IN EVERY PRISON FOR PRISONERS READY TO PROVE THEY ARE 
DRUG-FREE.


VICTIMS 

VICTIMS OF CRIME ARE TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
SYSTEM. WE WILL ENSURE THAT VICTIMS ARE KEPT FULLY INFORMED OF 
THE PROGRESS OF THEIR CASE, AND WHY CHARGES MAY HAVE BEEN 
DOWNGRADED OR DROPPED. 
GREATER PROTECTION WILL BE PROVIDED FOR VICTIMS IN RAPE AND 
SERIOUS SEXUAL OFFENCE TRIALS AND FOR THOSE SUBJECT TO 
INTIMIDATION, INCLUDING WITNESSES.


PREVENTION 

WE WILL PLACE A NEW RESPONSIBILITY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO DEVELOP 
STATUTORY PARTNERSHIPS TO HELP PREVENT CRIME. LOCAL COUNCILS WILL 
THEN BE REQUIRED TO SET TARGETS FOR THE REDUCTION OF CRIME AND 
DISORDER IN THEIR AREA. 


GUN CONTROL 

IN THE WAKE OF DUNBLANE AND HUNGERFORD, IT IS CLEAR THAT ONLY THE 
STRICTEST FIREARMS LAWS CAN PROVIDE MAXIMUM SAFETY. THE 
CONSERVATIVES FAILED TO OFFER THE PROTECTION REQUIRED. LABOUR LED 
THE CALL FOR AN OUTRIGHT BAN ON ALL HANDGUNS IN GENERAL CIVILIAN 
USE. THERE WILL BE LEGISLATION TO ALLOW INDIVIDUAL MPS A FREE VOTE 
FOR A COMPLETE BAN ON HANDGUNS. 
LABOUR IS THE PARTY OF LAW AND ORDER IN BRITAIN TODAY.


WE WILL
STRENGTHEN 
FAMILY LIFE


- HELP PARENTS BALANCE WORK AND FAMILY
- SECURITY IN HOUSING AND HELP FOR HOMEOWNERS
- TACKLE HOMELESSNESS USING RECEIPTS FROM COUNCIL HOUSE SALES
- DIGNITY AND SECURITY IN RETIREMENT
- PROTECT THE BASIC STATE PENSION AND PROMOTE SECURE SECOND 
PENSIONS


WE WILL UPHOLD FAMILY LIFE AS THE MOST SECURE MEANS OF BRINGING 
UP OUR CHILDREN. FAMILIES ARE THE CORE OF OUR SOCIETY. THEY 
SHOULD TEACH RIGHT FROM WRONG. THEY SHOULD BE THE FIRST DEFENCE 
AGAINST ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR. THE BREAKDOWN OF FAMILY LIFE 
DAMAGES THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY.
LABOUR DOES NOT SEE FAMILIES AND THE STATE AS RIVAL PROVIDERS FOR 
THE NEEDS OF OUR CITIZENS. FAMILIES SHOULD PROVIDE THE DAY-TO-DAY 
SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN TO BE BROUGHT UP IN A STABLE AND LOVING 
ENVIRONMENT. BUT FAMILIES CANNOT FLOURISH UNLESS GOVERNMENT 
PLAYS ITS DISTINCTIVE ROLE: IN EDUCATION; WHERE NECESSARY, IN CARING 
FOR THE YOUNG; IN MAKING ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR ILLNESS AND OLD 
AGE; IN SUPPORTING GOOD PARENTING; AND IN PROTECTING FAMILIES 
FROM LAWLESSNESS AND
ABUSE OF POWER. SOCIETY, THROUGH GOVERNMENT, MUST ASSIST 
FAMILIES TO ACHIEVE COLLECTIVELY WHAT NO FAMILY CAN ACHIEVE ALONE. 
YET FAMILIES IN BRITAIN TODAY ARE UNDER STRAIN AS NEVER BEFORE. 
THE SECURITY ONCE OFFERED BY THE HEALTH SERVICE HAS BEEN 
UNDERMINED. STREETS ARE NOT SAFE. HOUSING INSECURITY GROWS. 
ONE IN FIVE NON-PENSIONER FAMILIES HAS NO ONE WORKING; AND 
BRITISH MEN WORK THE LONGEST HOURS IN EUROPE.
THE CLOCK SHOULD NOT BE TURNED BACK. AS MANY WOMEN WHO 
WANT TO WORK SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO. MORE EQUAL RELATIONSHIPS 
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN HAVE TRANSFORMED OUR LIVES. EQUALLY, 
OUR ATTITUDES TO RACE, SEX AND SEXUALITY HAVE CHANGED 
FUNDAMENTALLY. OUR TASK IS TO COMBINE CHANGE AND SOCIAL 
STABILITY.


WORK AND FAMILY 

FAMILIES WITHOUT WORK ARE WITHOUT INDEPENDENCE. THIS IS WHY 
WE GIVE SO MUCH EMPHASIS TO OUR WELFARE-TO-WORK POLICIES. 
LABOUR'S NATIONAL CHILDCARE STRATEGY WILL PLAN PROVISION TO MATCH 
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MODERN LABOUR MARKET AND HELP PARENTS, 
ESPECIALLY WOMEN, TO BALANCE FAMILY AND WORKING LIFE.
THERE MUST BE A SOUND BALANCE BETWEEN SUPPORT FOR FAMILY LIFE 
AND THE PROTECTION OF BUSINESS FROM UNDUE BURDENS - A BALANCE 
WHICH SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES ALREADY STRIKE. 
THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN ITSELF WHOLLY INSENSITIVE TO 
THE NEED TO HELP DEVELOP FAMILY-FRIENDLY WORKING PRACTICES. 
WHILE RECOGNISING THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY IN IMPLEMENTATION AND 
FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS, WE SUPPORT THE RIGHT OF EMPLOYEES NOT TO 
BE FORCED TO WORK MORE THAN 48 HOURS A WEEK; TO AN ANNUAL 
HOLIDAY ENTITLEMENT; AND TO LIMITED UNPAID PARENTAL LEAVE. THESE 
MEASURES WILL PROVIDE A VALUABLE UNDERPINNING TO FAMILY LIFE.
THE RIGHTS OF PART-TIME WORKERS HAVE BEEN CLARIFIED BY RECENT 
COURT JUDGEMENTS WHICH WE WELCOME.
WE WILL KEEP UNDER CONTINUOUS REVIEW ALL ASPECTS OF THE TAX AND 
BENEFITS SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF FAMILIES 
AND CHILDREN. WE ARE COMMITTED TO RETAIN UNIVERSAL CHILD BENEFIT 
WHERE IT IS UNIVERSAL TODAY - FROM BIRTH TO AGE 16 - AND TO UPRATE 
IT AT LEAST IN LINE WITH PRICES. WE ARE REVIEWING EDUCATIONAL 
FINANCE AND MAINTENANCE FOR THOSE OLDER THAN 16 TO ENSURE HIGHER 
STAYING-ON RATES AT SCHOOL AND COLLEGE, AND THAT RESOURCES ARE 
USED TO SUPPORT THOSE IN MOST NEED. THIS REVIEW WILL CONTINUE IN 
GOVERNMENT ON THE GUIDELINES WE HAVE ALREADY LAID DOWN. 


SECURITY IN HOUSING 

MOST FAMILIES WANT TO OWN THEIR OWN HOMES. WE WILL ALSO 
SUPPORT EFFICIENTLY RUN SOCIAL AND PRIVATE RENTED SECTORS OFFERING 
QUALITY AND CHOICE.
THE CONSERVATIVES' FAILURE ON HOUSING HAS BEEN TWOFOLD. THE 
TWO THIRDS OF FAMILIES WHO OWN THEIR HOMES HAVE SUFFERED A 
MASSIVE INCREASE IN INSECURITY OVER THE LAST DECADE, WITH RECORD 
MORTGAGE ARREARS, RECORD NEGATIVE EQUITY AND RECORD 
REPOSSESSIONS. AND THE CONSERVATIVES' LACK OF A HOUSING 
STRATEGY HAS LED TO THE VIRTUAL ABANDONMENT OF SOCIAL HOUSING, THE 
GROWTH OF HOMELESSNESS, AND A FAILURE TO ADDRESS FULLY 
LEASEHOLDER REFORM. ALL THESE ARE THE TORY LEGACY. 
LABOUR'S HOUSING STRATEGY WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF 
HOMEOWNERS AND TENANTS ALIKE.
WE WILL REJECT THE BOOM AND BUST POLICIES WHICH CAUSED THE 
COLLAPSE OF THE HOUSING MARKET. 
WE WILL WORK WITH MORTGAGE PROVIDERS TO ENCOURAGE GREATER 
PROVISION OF MORE FLEXIBLE MORTGAGES TO PROTECT FAMILIES IN A 
WORLD OF INCREASED JOB INSECURITY. 
MORTGAGE BUYERS ALSO REQUIRE STRONGER CONSUMER PROTECTION, FOR 
EXAMPLE BY EXTENSION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ACT, AGAINST THE 
SALE OF DISADVANTAGEOUS MORTGAGE PACKAGES.
THE PROBLEMS OF GAZUMPING HAVE REAPPEARED. THOSE WHO BREAK 
THEIR BARGAINS SHOULD BE LIABLE TO PAY THE COSTS INFLICTED ON 
OTHERS, IN PARTICULAR LEGAL AND SURVEY COSTS. WE ARE CONSULTING ON 
THE BEST WAY OF TACKLING THE PROBLEMS OF GAZUMPING IN THE 
INTERESTS OF RESPONSIBLE HOME BUYERS AND SELLERS. 


THE RENTED HOUSING SECTOR

WE SUPPORT A THREE-WAY PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PUBLIC, PRIVATE 
AND HOUSING ASSOCIATION SECTORS TO PROMOTE GOOD SOCIAL HOUSING. 
WITH LABOUR, CAPITAL RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE OF COUNCIL HOUSES, 
RECEIVED BUT NOT SPENT BY LOCAL COUNCILS, WILL BE RE-INVESTED IN 
BUILDING NEW HOUSES AND REHABILITATING OLD ONES. THIS WILL BE 
PHASED TO MATCH THE CAPACITY OF THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AND TO MEET 
THE REQUIREMENTS OF PRUDENT ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. 
WE ALSO SUPPORT EFFECTIVE SCHEMES TO DEPLOY PRIVATE FINANCE TO 
IMPROVE THE PUBLIC HOUSING STOCK AND TO INTRODUCE GREATER 
DIVERSITY AND CHOICE. SUCH SCHEMES SHOULD ONLY GO AHEAD WITH 
THE SUPPORT OF THE TENANTS CONCERNED: WE OPPOSE THE 
GOVERNMENT'S THREAT TO HAND OVER COUNCIL HOUSING TO PRIVATE 
LANDLORDS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF TENANTS AND WITH NO GUARANTEES 
ON RENTS OR SECURITY OF TENURE. 
WE VALUE A REVIVED PRIVATE RENTED SECTOR. WE WILL PROVIDE 
PROTECTION WHERE MOST NEEDED: FOR TENANTS IN HOUSES IN MULTIPLE 
OCCUPATION. 
THERE WILL BE A PROPER SYSTEM OF LICENSING BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
WHICH WILL BENEFIT TENANTS AND RESPONSIBLE LANDLORDS ALIKE. 
WE WILL INTRODUCE 'COMMONHOLD', A NEW FORM OF TENURE ENABLING 
PEOPLE LIVING IN FLATS TO OWN THEIR HOMES INDIVIDUALLY AND TO OWN 
THE WHOLE PROPERTY COLLECTIVELY. WE WILL SIMPLIFY THE CURRENT 
RULES RESTRICTING THE PURCHASE OF FREEHOLDS BY LEASEHOLDERS. 


HOMELESSNESS

HOMELESSNESS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES. 
TODAY MORE THAN 40,000 FAMILIES IN ENGLAND ARE IN EXPENSIVE 
TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION. THE GOVERNMENT, IN THE FACE OF 
LABOUR OPPOSITION, HAS REMOVED THE DUTY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO 
FIND PERMANENT HOUSING FOR HOMELESS FAMILIES. WE WILL IMPOSE A 
NEW DUTY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS 
THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN AND ARE IN PRIORITY NEED.
THERE IS NO MORE POWERFUL SYMBOL OF TORY NEGLECT IN OUR SOCIETY 
TODAY THAN YOUNG PEOPLE WITHOUT HOMES LIVING ROUGH ON THE 
STREETS. YOUNG PEOPLE EMERGING FROM CARE WITHOUT ANY FAMILY 
SUPPORT ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE. WE WILL ATTACK THE 
PROBLEM IN TWO PRINCIPAL WAYS: THE PHASED RELEASE OF CAPITAL 
RECEIPTS FROM COUNCIL HOUSE SALES WILL INCREASE THE STOCK OF 
HOUSING FOR RENT; AND OUR WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAMME WILL LEAD 
THE YOUNG UNEMPLOYED INTO WORK AND FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE. 


OLDER CITIZENS 

WE VALUE THE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION THAT OLDER PEOPLE MAKE TO OUR 
SOCIETY, THROUGH THEIR FAMILIES, VOLUNTARY ACTIVITIES AND WORK. 
THEIR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE UTILISED WITHIN THEIR 
COMMUNITIES. THAT IS WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, WE SUPPORT THE 
PROPOSAL TO INVOLVE OLDER PEOPLE AS VOLUNTEERS TO HELP CHILDREN 
LEARN IN PRE-SCHOOL AND AFTER-SCHOOL CLUBS. IN WORK, THEY SHOULD 
NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE. 
THE PROVISION OF ADEQUATE PENSIONS IN OLD AGE IS A MAJOR 
CHALLENGE FOR THE FUTURE. FOR TODAY'S PENSIONERS CONSERVATIVE 
POLICIES HAVE CREATED REAL POVERTY, GROWING INEQUALITY AND 
WIDESPREAD INSECURITY. 
THE CONSERVATIVES WOULD ABOLISH THE STATE-FINANCED BASIC 
RETIREMENT PENSION AND REPLACE IT WITH A PRIVATISED SCHEME, WITH 
A VAGUE PROMISE OF A MEANS-TESTED STATE GUARANTEE IF PENSIONS 
FALL BENEATH A MINIMUM LEVEL. THEIR PROPOSALS MEAN THERE WILL BE 
NO SAVINGS ON WELFARE SPENDING FOR HALF A CENTURY; AND TAXES WILL 
HAVE TO RISE TO MAKE PROVISION FOR NEW PRIVATELY FUNDED 
PENSIONS. THEIR PLANS REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 312 BILLION POUNDS 
BETWEEN NOW AND 2040 THROUGH INCREASED TAXES OR BORROWING, 
AGAINST THE HOPE OF SAVINGS LATER, WITH NO CERTAINTY OF SECURITY IN 
RETIREMENT AT THE END. 
WE BELIEVE THAT ALL PENSIONERS SHOULD SHARE FAIRLY IN THE 
INCREASING PROSPERITY OF THE NATION. INSTEAD OF PRIVATISATION, WE 
PROPOSE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVISION, AND 
A BALANCE BETWEEN INCOME SOURCED FROM TAX AND INVESTED 
SAVINGS. THE BASIC STATE PENSION WILL BE RETAINED AS THE 
FOUNDATION OF PENSION PROVISION. IT WILL BE INCREASED AT LEAST IN 
LINE WITH PRICES. WE WILL EXAMINE MEANS OF DELIVERING MORE 
AUTOMATIC HELP TO THE POOREST PENSIONERS - ONE MILLION OF WHOM 
DO NOT EVEN RECEIVE THE INCOME SUPPORT WHICH IS THEIR PRESENT 
ENTITLEMENT.
WE WILL ENCOURAGE SAVING FOR RETIREMENT, WITH PROPER PROTECTION 
FOR SAVINGS. WE WILL REFORM THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ACT SO THAT 
THE SCANDAL OF PENSION MIS-SELLING - 600,000 PENSIONS MIS-SOLD 
AND ONLY 7,000 PEOPLE COMPENSATED TO DATE - WILL NOT HAPPEN 
AGAIN.
TOO MANY PEOPLE IN WORK, PARTICULARLY THOSE ON LOW AND MODEST 
INCOMES AND WITH CHANGING PATTERNS OF EMPLOYMENT, CANNOT JOIN 
GOOD-VALUE SECOND PENSION SCHEMES. LABOUR WILL CREATE A NEW 
FRAMEWORK - STAKEHOLDER PENSIONS - TO MEET THIS NEED. WE WILL 
ENCOURAGE NEW PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN FINANCIAL SERVICE 
COMPANIES, EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES TO DEVELOP THESE PENSION 
SCHEMES. THEY WILL BE APPROVED TO RECEIVE PEOPLE'S SAVINGS 
ONLY IF THEY MEET HIGH STANDARDS OF VALUE FOR MONEY, FLEXIBILITY 
AND SECURITY. 
LABOUR WILL PROMOTE CHOICE IN PENSION PROVISION. WE WILL 
SUPPORT AND STRENGTHEN THE FRAMEWORK FOR OCCUPATIONAL 
PENSIONS. PERSONAL PENSIONS, APPROPRIATELY REGULATED, WILL 
REMAIN A GOOD OPTION FOR MANY. LABOUR WILL RETAIN SERPS AS AN 
OPTION FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO REMAIN WITHIN IT. WE WILL ALSO SEEK 
TO DEVELOP THE ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF SERPS SO AS TO CREATE 
A 'CITIZENSHIP PENSION' FOR THOSE WHO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY AS 
CARERS, AS A RESULT LOSE OUT ON THE PENSION ENTITLEMENTS THEY 
WOULD OTHERWISE ACQUIRE, AND CURRENTLY END UP ON MEANS-TESTED 
BENEFITS. 
WE OVERCAME GOVERNMENT OPPOSITION TO PENSION SPLITTING 
BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN ON DIVORCE. WE WILL IMPLEMENT THIS IN 
GOVERNMENT. 
WE AIM TO PROVIDE REAL SECURITY FOR FAMILIES THROUGH A MODERN 
SYSTEM OF COMMUNITY CARE. AS PEOPLE GROW OLDER, THEIR NEED FOR 
CARE INCREASES. THE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH IS TO PROMOTE PRIVATE 
INSURANCE AND PRIVATISATION OF CARE HOMES. BUT PRIVATE INSURANCE 
WILL BE INACCESSIBLE TO MOST PEOPLE. AND THEIR POLICY FOR 
RESIDENTIAL HOMES IS DOGMATIC AND WILL NOT WORK. WE BELIEVE THAT 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE FREE TO DEVELOP A MIX OF PUBLIC AND 
PRIVATE CARE. 
WE RECOGNISE THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF CARE PROVISION UNDERTAKEN 
BY FAMILY MEMBERS, NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS. IT WAS A LABOUR 
MP WHO PILOTED THE 1995 CARERS ACT THROUGH PARLIAMENT. WE 
WILL ESTABLISH A ROYAL COMMISSION TO WORK OUT A FAIR SYSTEM FOR 
FUNDING LONG-TERM CARE FOR THE ELDERLY. WE WILL INTRODUCE A 
'LONG-TERM CARE CHARTER' DEFINING THE STANDARD OF SERVICES WHICH 
PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO EXPECT FROM HEALTH, HOUSING AND SOCIAL 
SERVICES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTION AND 
REGULATION SERVICE FOR RESIDENTIAL HOMES, AND DOMICILIARY CARE. 
EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO DIGNITY IN RETIREMENT. UNDER THE TORIES, 
THE EARNINGS LINK FOR STATE PENSIONS HAS BEEN ENDED, VAT ON FUEL 
HAS BEEN IMPOSED, SERPS HAS BEEN UNDERMINED AND COMMUNITY 
CARE IS IN TATTERS. WE WILL SET UP A REVIEW OF THE CENTRAL AREAS OF 
INSECURITY FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE: ALL ASPECTS OF THE BASIC PENSION AND 
ITS VALUE, SECOND PENSIONS INCLUDING SERPS, AND COMMUNITY 
CARE. THE REVIEW WILL ENSURE THAT THE VIEWS OF PENSIONERS ARE 
HEARD. OUR WATCHWORD IN DEVELOPING POLICY FOR PENSIONS AND 
LONG-TERM CARE WILL BE TO BUILD CONSENSUS AMONG ALL INTERESTED 
PARTIES.


WE WILL
HELP YOU GET MORE 
OUT OF LIFE


- EVERY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT A 'GREEN' DEPARTMENT
- EFFICIENT AND CLEAN TRANSPORT FOR ALL
- NEW ARTS AND SCIENCE TALENT FUND FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
- REFORM THE LOTTERY
- IMPROVE LIFE IN RURAL AREAS
- BACK WORLD CUP BID


THE MILLENNIUM IS THE TIME TO REAFFIRM OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO 
PROTECT AND ENHANCE OUR ENVIRONMENT SO THAT THE COUNTRY WE 
HAND ON TO OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN IS A BETTER PLACE IN 
WHICH TO LIVE. IT ALSO PROVIDES A NATURAL OPPORTUNITY TO CELEBRATE 
AND IMPROVE THE CONTRIBUTION MADE BY THE ARTS, CULTURE AND SPORT 
TO OUR NATION. WE NEED A NEW AND DYNAMIC APPROACH TO THE 
'CREATIVE ECONOMY'. THE DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL HERITAGE WILL 
DEVELOP A STRATEGIC VISION THAT MATCHES THE REAL POWER AND ENERGY 
OF BRITISH ARTS, MEDIA AND CULTURAL INDUSTRIES. 


PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT 

OUR GENERATION, AND GENERATIONS YET TO COME, ARE DEPENDENT ON 
THE INTEGRITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT. NO ONE CAN ESCAPE UNHEALTHY 
WATER, POLLUTED AIR OR ADVERSE CLIMATE CHANGE. AND JUST AS THESE 
PROBLEMS AFFECT US ALL, SO WE MUST ACT TOGETHER TO TACKLE THEM. 
NO RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT CAN AFFORD TO TAKE RISKS WITH THE 
FUTURE: THE COST IS TOO HIGH. SO IT IS OUR DUTY TO ACT NOW.
THE FOUNDATION OF LABOUR'S ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACH IS THAT 
PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT CANNOT BE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF 
ANY ONE DEPARTMENT OF STATE. ALL DEPARTMENTS MUST PROMOTE 
POLICIES TO SUSTAIN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND PARLIAMENT SHOULD HAVE 
AN ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT COMMITTEE TO ENSURE HIGH STANDARDS 
ACROSS GOVERNMENT.
THROUGHOUT THIS MANIFESTO, THERE ARE POLICIES DESIGNED TO 
COMBINE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WITH ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
PROGRESS. THEY EXTEND FROM COMMITMENTS AT LOCAL LEVEL TO GIVE 
COMMUNITIES ENHANCED CONTROL OVER THEIR ENVIRONMENTS, TO 
INITIATIVES AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. 
A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ABOVE ALL AN EFFECTIVE AND 
INTEGRATED TRANSPORT POLICY AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL 
THAT WILL PROVIDE GENUINE CHOICE TO MEET PEOPLE'S TRANSPORT 
NEEDS. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL ESTABLISH AND DEVELOP.


RAILWAYS

THE PROCESS OF RAIL PRIVATISATION IS NOW LARGELY COMPLETE. IT HAS 
MADE FORTUNES FOR A FEW, BUT HAS BEEN A POOR DEAL FOR THE 
TAXPAYER. IT HAS FRAGMENTED THE NETWORK AND NOW THREATENS 
SERVICES. OUR TASK WILL BE TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION AS WE FIND IT, 
NOT AS WE WISH IT TO BE. OUR OVERRIDING GOAL MUST BE TO WIN MORE 
PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT ON TO RAIL. THE SYSTEM MUST BE RUN IN THE 
PUBLIC INTEREST WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF INVESTMENT AND EFFECTIVE 
ENFORCEMENT OF TRAIN OPERATORS' SERVICE COMMITMENTS. THERE 
MUST BE CONVENIENT CONNECTIONS, THROUGH-TICKETING AND ACCURATE 
TRAVEL INFORMATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL PASSENGERS. 
TO ACHIEVE THESE AIMS, WE WILL ESTABLISH MORE EFFECTIVE AND 
ACCOUNTABLE REGULATION BY THE RAIL REGULATOR; WE WILL ENSURE THAT 
THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY SERVES THE PUBLIC INTEREST; AND WE WILL 
ESTABLISH A NEW RAIL AUTHORITY, COMBINING FUNCTIONS CURRENTLY 
CARRIED OUT BY THE RAIL FRANCHISER AND THE DEPARTMENT OF 
TRANSPORT, TO PROVIDE A CLEAR, COHERENT AND STRATEGIC PROGRAMME 
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RAILWAYS SO THAT PASSENGER 
EXPECTATIONS ARE MET. 
THE CONSERVATIVE PLAN FOR THE WHOLESALE PRIVATISATION OF LONDON 
UNDERGROUND IS NOT THE ANSWER. IT WOULD BE A POOR DEAL FOR THE 
TAXPAYER AND PASSENGER ALIKE. YET AGAIN, PUBLIC ASSETS WOULD BE 
SOLD OFF AT AN UNDER-VALUED RATE. MUCH-NEEDED INVESTMENT WOULD 
BE DELAYED. THE CORE PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE UNDERGROUND 
WOULD BE THREATENED.
LABOUR PLANS A NEW PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO IMPROVE THE 
UNDERGROUND, SAFEGUARD ITS COMMITMENT TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST 
AND GUARANTEE VALUE FOR MONEY TO TAXPAYERS AND PASSENGERS. 


ROAD TRANSPORT

A BALANCED TRANSPORT SYSTEM MUST CATER FOR ALL THE FAMILIAR MODES 
OF TRANSPORT: CARS - WHETHER OWNED, LEASED OR SHARED; TAXIS; 
BUSES; BICYCLES AND MOTORCYCLES. ALL NEEDS MUST BE ADDRESSED IN 
TRANSPORT PLANNING TO ENSURE THE BEST MIX OF ALL TYPES OF 
TRANSPORT, OFFER QUALITY PUBLIC TRANSPORT WHEREVER POSSIBLE AND 
HELP TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. 
THE KEY TO EFFICIENT BUS SERVICES 
IS PROPER REGULATION AT LOCAL LEVEL, WITH PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN 
LOCAL COUNCILS AND BUS OPERATORS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT. THERE 
MUST BE IMPROVED PROVISION AND ENFORCEMENT OF BUS LANES. 
BETTER PARKING FACILITIES FOR CARS MUST BE LINKED TO CONVENIENT BUS 
SERVICES TO TOWN CENTRES. 

 ROAD SAFETY IS A HIGH PRIORITY. CYCLING AND WALKING MUST BE 
MADE SAFER, ESPECIALLY AROUND SCHOOLS. 

 WE REMAIN UNPERSUADED BY THE CASE FOR HEAVIER, 44-TONNE 
LORRIES MOOTED BY THE CONSERVATIVES. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THEY 
WOULD PROVE DANGEROUS AND  DAMAGING TO THE ENVIRONMENT. 

 OUR PLANS TO REDUCE POLLUTION INCLUDE WORKING WITH THE 
AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP 'SMART', EFFICIENT AND CLEAN CARS 
FOR THE FUTURE, WITH SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED EMISSION LEVELS. THE 
REVIEW OF VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY TO PROMOTE LOW-EMISSION VEHICLES 
WILL BE CONTINUED.  WE WILL CONDUCT AN OVERALL STRATEGIC REVIEW 
OF THE ROADS PROGRAMME AGAINST THE CRITERIA OF ACCESSIBILITY, 
SAFETY, ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, USING PUBLIC/PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPROVE ROAD MAINTENANCE AND EXPLOITING NEW 
TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE JOURNEY INFORMATION.  


SHIPPING AND AVIATION 

 THE TORY YEARS HAVE SEEN THE NEAR-EXTINCTION OF BRITAIN'S 
MERCHANT FLEET.  LABOUR WILL WORK WITH ALL CONCERNED IN SHIPPING 
AND PORTS TO HELP DEVELOP THEIR  ECONOMIC POTENTIAL TO THE FULL. 

 THE GUIDING OBJECTIVES OF OUR AVIATION STRATEGY WILL BE FAIR 
COMPETITION, SAFETY  AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. WE WANT ALL 
BRITISH CARRIERS TO BE ABLE TO  COMPETE FAIRLY IN THE INTERESTS OF 
CONSUMERS. 

 LIFE IN OUR COUNTRYSIDE 

 LABOUR RECOGNISES THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND 
WORK IN RURAL  AREAS. THE CONSERVATIVES DO NOT. PUBLIC SERVICES 
AND TRANSPORT SERVICES IN RURAL
 AREAS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO DETERIORATE. THE CONSERVATIVES 
HAVE TRIED TO  PRIVATISE THE POST OFFICE. WE OPPOSED THAT, IN 
FAVOUR OF A PUBLIC POST OFFICE  PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE 
SERVICE. CONSERVATIVE PLANS WOULD MEAN HIGHER  CHARGES FOR 
LETTERS AND PUT RURAL POST OFFICES UNDER THREAT. 

 WE FAVOUR A MORATORIUM ON LARGE-SCALE SALES OF FORESTRY 
COMMISSION LAND.  WE RECOGNISE THAT THE COUNTRYSIDE IS A GREAT 
NATURAL ASSET, A PART OF OUR HERITAGE  WHICH CALLS FOR CAREFUL 
STEWARDSHIP. THIS MUST BE BALANCED, HOWEVER, WITH THE  NEEDS 
OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN RURAL AREAS.  

 THE TOTAL FAILURE OF THE CONSERVATIVES TO MANAGE THE BSE CRISIS 
EFFECTIVELY AND  TO SECURE ANY RAISING OF THE BAN ON BRITISH BEEF 
HAS WREAKED HAVOC ON THE BEEF  AND DAIRY INDUSTRIES. THE COST TO 
THE TAXPAYER SO FAR IS £3.5 BILLION. 

 LABOUR AIMS TO REFORM THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY TO SAVE 
MONEY, TO  SUPPORT THE RURAL ECONOMY AND ENHANCE THE 
ENVIRONMENT. 

 OUR INITIATIVES TO LINK ALL SCHOOLS TO THE INFORMATION 
SUPERHIGHWAY WILL ENSURE  THAT CHILDREN IN RURAL AREAS HAVE 
ACCESS TO THE BEST EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. 

 OUR POLICIES INCLUDE GREATER FREEDOM FOR PEOPLE TO EXPLORE OUR 
OPEN  COUNTRYSIDE. WE WILL NOT, HOWEVER, PERMIT ANY ABUSE OF A 
RIGHT TO GREATER  ACCESS. 

 WE WILL ENSURE GREATER PROTECTION FOR WILDLIFE. WE HAVE 
ADVOCATED NEW  MEASURES TO PROMOTE ANIMAL WELFARE, INCLUDING A 
FREE VOTE IN PARLIAMENT ON  WHETHER HUNTING WITH HOUNDS SHOULD 
BE BANNED BY LEGISLATION. 

 ANGLING IS BRITAIN'S MOST POPULAR SPORT. LABOUR'S ANGLERS' 
CHARTER AFFIRMS OUR  LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO ANGLING AND TO 
THE OBJECTIVE OF PROTECTING THE  AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT. 

 ARTS AND CULTURE 

 THE ARTS, CULTURE AND SPORT ARE CENTRAL TO THE TASK OF RECREATING 
THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY, IDENTITY AND CIVIC PRIDE THAT SHOULD 
DEFINE OUR COUNTRY. YET WE CONSISTENTLY UNDERVALUE THE ROLE OF 
THE ARTS AND CULTURE IN HELPING TO CREATE A CIVIC SOCIETY - FROM 
AMATEUR THEATRE TO OUR ART GALLERIES. 

 ART, SPORT AND LEISURE ARE VITAL TO OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE 
RENEWAL OF OUR ECONOMY. THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT EARNERS FOR 
BRITAIN. THEY EMPLOY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THEY 
BRING MILLIONS OF TOURISTS TO BRITAIN EVERY YEAR, WHO WILL ALSO BE 
HELPED BY LABOUR'S PLANS FOR NEW QUALITY ASSURANCE IN HOTEL 
ACCOMMODATION. 

 WE PROPOSE TO SET UP A NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR SCIENCE AND 
THE ARTS TO SPONSOR YOUNG TALENT. NESTA WILL BE A NATIONAL TRUST 
- FOR TALENT RATHER THAN BUILDINGS - FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. NESTA 
WILL BE PARTLY FUNDED BY THE LOTTERY; AND ARTISTS WHO HAVE GAINED 
HIGH REWARDS FROM THEIR EXCELLENCE IN THE ARTS AND WISH TO 
SUPPORT YOUNG TALENT WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO DONATE COPYRIGHT AND 
ROYALTIES TO NESTA.

 SPORT 

 A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE THE LEAD IN EXTENDING 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPATION IN SPORTS; AND IN IDENTIFYING 
SPORTING EXCELLENCE AND SUPPORTING IT. 

 SCHOOL SPORTS MUST BE THE FOUNDATION. WE WILL BRING THE 
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY OF FORCING SCHOOLS TO SELL OFF PLAYING FIELDS 
TO AN END. WE WILL PROVIDE FULL BACKING TO THE BID TO HOST THE 
2006 FOOTBALL WORLD CUP IN ENGLAND. A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL 
ALSO WORK TO BRING THE OLYMPICS AND OTHER MAJOR INTERNATIONAL 
SPORTING EVENTS TO BRITAIN.

 A PEOPLE'S LOTTERY 

 THE LOTTERY HAS BEEN A FINANCIAL SUCCESS. BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO 
OVERALL STRATEGY FOR THE ALLOCATION OF MONIES; AND NO CO-
ORDINATION AMONG THE FIVE DISTRIBUTOR BODIES ABOUT THE PROJECTS 
DESERVING TO BENEFIT FROM LOTTERY FUNDING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 
MULTI-MILLION-POUND EXPENDITURE ON THE CHURCHILL PAPERS CAUSED 
NATIONAL OUTRAGE. A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL REVIEW THE 
DISTRIBUTION OF LOTTERY PROCEEDS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS THE WIDEST 
POSSIBLE ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF LOTTERY REVENUES THROUGHOUT THE 
UK. 

 LABOUR HAS ALREADY PROPOSED A NEW MILLENNIUM COMMISSION TO 
COMMENCE AFTER THE CLOSURE OF THE MILLENNIUM EXHIBITION, TO 
PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT FOR A RANGE OF EDUCATION, ENVIRONMENT AND 
PUBLIC HEALTH PROJECTS, INCLUDING THOSE DIRECTED AT CHILDREN'S 
PLAY, A PROJECT CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM LOTTERY BENEFIT. 

 BECAUSE THE LOTTERY IS A MONOPOLY INTENDED TO SERVE THE PUBLIC 
INTEREST, IT MUST BE ADMINISTERED EFFICIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY. 
WHEN THE CURRENT CONTRACT RUNS OUT, LABOUR WILL SEEK AN EFFICIENT 
NOT-FOR-PROFIT OPERATOR TO ENSURE THAT THE MAXIMUM SUMS GO TO 
GOOD CAUSES. 

 MEDIA AND BROADCASTING 

 LABOUR AIMS FOR A THRIVING, DIVERSE MEDIA INDUSTRY, COMBINING 
COMMERCIAL SUCCESS AND PUBLIC SERVICE. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE 
BBC CONTINUES TO BE A FLAGSHIP FOR BRITISH CREATIVITY AND PUBLIC 
SERVICE BROADCASTING, BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMBINATION OF 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS IN COMPETITION IS A KEY SPUR TO 
INNOVATION AND HIGH STANDARDS. THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR 
MEDIA AND BROADCASTING SHOULD REFLECT THE REALITIES OF A FAR MORE 
OPEN AND COMPETITIVE ECONOMY, AND ENORMOUS TECHNOLOGICAL 
ADVANCE, FOR EXAMPLE WITH DIGITAL TELEVISION. LABOUR WILL BALANCE 
SENSIBLE RULES, FAIR REGULATION AND NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
COMPETITION, SO MAINTAINING QUALITY AND DIVERSITY FOR THE BENEFIT 
OF VIEWERS.

 CITIZENS' SERVICE FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM 

 AN INDEPENDENT AND CREATIVE VOLUNTARY SECTOR, COMMITTED TO 
VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY AS AN EXPRESSION OF CITIZENSHIP, IS CENTRAL TO 
OUR VISION OF A STAKEHOLDER SOCIETY. WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
DEVELOPING PLANS FOR A NATIONAL CITIZENS' SERVICE PROGRAMME, TO 
TAP THE ENTHUSIASM AND COMMITMENT OF THE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHO WANT TO MAKE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS IN SERVICE OF THEIR 
COMMUNITIES. THE MILLENNIUM SHOULD HARNESS THE IMAGINATION OF 
ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE 
COMMUNITY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE PROGRAMMES SHOULD BE IMPOSED 
FROM THE TOP DOWN, BUT ON THE CONTRARY WISH TO ENCOURAGE A 
BROAD RANGE OF VOLUNTARY INITIATIVES DEVISED AND DEVELOPED BY 
PEOPLE WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. 

 WE WILL CLEAN UP POLITICS

 - END THE HEREDITARY PRINCIPLE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS 

 - REFORM OF PARTY FUNDING TO END SLEAZE 

 - DEVOLVED POWER IN SCOTLAND AND WALES 

 - ELECTED MAYORS FOR LONDON AND OTHER CITIES 

 - MORE INDEPENDENT BUT ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 

 - FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND GUARANTEED HUMAN RIGHTS 

 THE CONSERVATIVES SEEM OPPOSED TO THE VERY IDEA OF 
DEMOCRACY. THEY SUPPORT HEREDITARY PEERS, UNACCOUNTABLE 
QUANGOS AND SECRETIVE GOVERNMENT. THEY HAVE DEBASED 
DEMOCRACY THROUGH THEIR MPS WHO HAVE TAKEN CASH FOR ASKING 
QUESTIONS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF DECENTRALISED GOVERNMENT. THE PARTY WHICH ONCE 
OPPOSED UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE AND VOTES FOR WOMEN NOW SAYS OUR 
CONSTITUTION IS SO PERFECT THAT IT CANNOT BE IMPROVED. 

 OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS CENTRALISED, INEFFICIENT AND 
BUREAUCRATIC. OUR CITIZENS CANNOT ASSERT THEIR BASIC RIGHTS IN OUR 
OWN COURTS. THE CONSERVATIVES ARE AFFLICTED BY SLEAZE AND 
PROSPER FROM SECRET FUNDS FROM FOREIGN SUPPORTERS. THERE IS 
UNQUESTIONABLY A NATIONAL CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR POLITICAL 
SYSTEM, TO WHICH LABOUR WILL RESPOND IN A MEASURED AND 
SENSIBLE WAY.

 A MODERN HOUSE OF LORDS 

 THE HOUSE OF LORDS MUST BE REFORMED. AS AN INITIAL, SELF-
CONTAINED REFORM, NOT DEPENDENT ON FURTHER REFORM IN THE FUTURE, 
THE RIGHT OF HEREDITARY PEERS TO SIT AND VOTE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS 
WILL BE ENDED BY STATUTE. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST STAGE IN A PROCESS 
OF REFORM TO MAKE THE HOUSE OF LORDS MORE DEMOCRATIC AND 
REPRESENTATIVE. THE LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS 
WILL REMAIN UNALTERED. 

 THE SYSTEM OF APPOINTMENT OF LIFE PEERS TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS 
WILL BE REVIEWED. OUR OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO ENSURE THAT OVER TIME 
PARTY APPOINTEES AS LIFE PEERS MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE 
PROPORTION OF VOTES CAST AT THE PREVIOUS GENERAL ELECTION. WE ARE 
COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING AN INDEPENDENT CROSS-BENCH PRESENCE 
OF LIFE PEERS. NO ONE POLITICAL PARTY SHOULD SEEK A MAJORITY IN THE 
HOUSE OF LORDS. 

 A COMMITTEE OF BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT WILL BE APPOINTED TO 
UNDERTAKE A WIDE-RANGING REVIEW OF POSSIBLE FURTHER CHANGE AND 
THEN TO BRING FORWARD PROPOSALS FOR REFORM. 

 WE HAVE NO PLANS TO REPLACE THE MONARCHY.

 AN EFFECTIVE HOUSE OF COMMONS 

 WE BELIEVE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS IN NEED OF MODERNISATION 
AND WE WILL ASK THE HOUSE TO ESTABLISH A SPECIAL SELECT 
COMMITTEE TO REVIEW ITS PROCEDURES. PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS 
WILL BE MADE MORE EFFECTIVE. MINISTERIAL ACCOUNTABILITY WILL BE 
REVIEWED SO AS TO REMOVE RECENT ABUSES. THE PROCESS FOR 
SCRUTINISING EUROPEAN LEGISLATION WILL BE OVERHAULED. 

 THE NOLAN RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND 
EXTENDED TO ALL PUBLIC BODIES. WE WILL OBLIGE PARTIES TO DECLARE 
THE SOURCE OF ALL DONATIONS ABOVE A MINIMUM FIGURE: LABOUR 
DOES THIS VOLUNTARILY AND ALL PARTIES SHOULD DO SO. FOREIGN 
FUNDING WILL BE BANNED. WE WILL ASK THE NOLAN COMMITTEE TO 
CONSIDER HOW THE FUNDING OF POLITICAL PARTIES SHOULD BE REGULATED 
AND REFORMED. 

 WE ARE COMMITTED TO A REFERENDUM ON THE VOTING SYSTEM FOR THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS. AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION ON VOTING 
SYSTEMS WILL 

 BE APPOINTED EARLY TO RECOMMEND A PROPORTIONAL ALTERNATIVE TO 
THE FIRST-PAST-THE-POST SYSTEM. 

 AT THIS ELECTION, LABOUR IS PROUD TO BE MAKING MAJOR STRIDES TO 
RECTIFY THE UNDER-REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN PUBLIC LIFE.

 OPEN GOVERNMENT 

 UNNECESSARY SECRECY IN GOVERNMENT LEADS TO ARROGANCE IN 
GOVERNMENT AND DEFECTIVE POLICY DECISIONS. THE SCOTT REPORT ON 
ARMS TO IRAQ REVEALED CONSERVATIVE ABUSES OF POWER. WE ARE 
PLEDGED TO A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, LEADING TO MORE OPEN 
GOVERNMENT, AND AN INDEPENDENT NATIONAL STATISTICAL SERVICE. 

 DEVOLUTION: STRENGTHENING THE UNION 

 THE UNITED KINGDOM IS A PARTNERSHIP ENRICHED BY DISTINCT 
NATIONAL IDENTITIES AND TRADITIONS. SCOTLAND HAS ITS OWN SYSTEMS 
OF EDUCATION, LAW AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WALES HAS ITS LANGUAGE 
AND CULTURAL TRADITIONS. WE WILL MEET THE DEMAND FOR 
DECENTRALISATION OF POWER TO SCOTLAND AND WALES, ONCE 
ESTABLISHED IN REFERENDUMS. 

 SUBSIDIARITY IS AS SOUND A PRINCIPLE IN BRITAIN AS IT IS IN EUROPE. 
OUR PROPOSAL IS FOR DEVOLUTION NOT FEDERATION. A SOVEREIGN 
WESTMINSTER PARLIAMENT WILL DEVOLVE POWER TO SCOTLAND AND 
WALES. THE UNION WILL BE STRENGTHENED AND THE THREAT OF 
SEPARATISM REMOVED. 

 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THE ELECTION, WE WILL ENACT LEGISLATION 
TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND AND WALES TO VOTE IN SEPARATE 
REFERENDUMS ON OUR PROPOSALS, WHICH WILL BE SET OUT IN WHITE 
PAPERS. THESE REFERENDUMS WILL TAKE PLACE NOT LATER THAN THE 
AUTUMN OF 1997. A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF THOSE VOTING IN EACH 
REFERENDUM WILL BE THE MAJORITY REQUIRED. POPULAR ENDORSEMENT 
WILL STRENGTHEN THE LEGITIMACY OF OUR PROPOSALS AND SPEED THEIR 
PASSAGE THROUGH PARLIAMENT. 

 FOR SCOTLAND WE PROPOSE THE CREATION OF A PARLIAMENT WITH LAW-
MAKING POWERS, FIRMLY BASED ON THE AGREEMENT REACHED IN THE 
SCOTTISH CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, INCLUDING DEFINED AND 
LIMITED FINANCIAL POWERS TO VARY REVENUE AND ELECTED BY AN 
ADDITIONAL MEMBER SYSTEM. IN THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM WE WILL 
SEEK SEPARATE ENDORSEMENT OF THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE A PARLIAMENT, 
AND OF THE PROPOSAL TO GIVE IT DEFINED AND LIMITED FINANCIAL 
POWERS TO VARY REVENUE. THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT WILL EXTEND 
DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OVER THE RESPONSIBILITIES CURRENTLY EXERCISED 
ADMINISTRATIVELY BY THE SCOTTISH OFFICE. THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
THE UK PARLIAMENT WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED OVER UK POLICY, FOR 
EXAMPLE ECONOMIC, DEFENCE AND FOREIGN POLICY. 

 THE WELSH ASSEMBLY WILL PROVIDE DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE 
EXISTING WELSH OFFICE FUNCTIONS. IT WILL HAVE SECONDARY 
LEGISLATIVE POWERS AND WILL BE SPECIFICALLY EMPOWERED TO REFORM 
AND DEMOCRATISE THE QUANGO STATE. IT WILL BE ELECTED BY AN 
ADDITIONAL MEMBER SYSTEM. 

 FOLLOWING MAJORITIES IN THE REFERENDUMS, WE WILL INTRODUCE IN 
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PARLIAMENT LEGISLATION ON THE SUBSTANTIVE 
DEVOLUTION PROPOSALS OUTLINED IN OUR WHITE PAPERS. 

 GOOD LOCAL GOVERNMENT 

 LOCAL DECISION-MAKING SHOULD BE LESS CONSTRAINED BY CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT, AND ALSO MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO LOCAL PEOPLE. WE WILL 
PLACE ON COUNCILS A NEW DUTY TO PROMOTE THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL 
AND ENVIRONMENTAL WELL-BEING OF THEIR AREA. THEY SHOULD WORK IN 
PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL PEOPLE, LOCAL BUSINESS AND LOCAL VOLUNTARY 
ORGANISATIONS. THEY WILL HAVE THE POWERS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP 
THESE PARTNERSHIPS. TO ENSURE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY, A 
PROPORTION OF COUNCILLORS IN EACH LOCALITY WILL BE ELECTED 
ANNUALLY. WE WILL ENCOURAGE DEMOCRATIC INNOVATIONS IN LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING PILOTS OF THE IDEA OF ELECTED MAYORS WITH 
EXECUTIVE POWERS IN CITIES. ALTHOUGH CRUDE AND UNIVERSAL COUNCIL 
TAX CAPPING SHOULD GO, WE WILL RETAIN RESERVE POWERS TO CONTROL 
EXCESSIVE COUNCIL TAX RISES. 

 LOCAL BUSINESS CONCERNS ARE CRITICAL TO GOOD LOCAL GOVERNMENT. 
THERE ARE SOUND DEMOCRATIC REASONS WHY, IN PRINCIPLE, THE 
BUSINESS RATE SHOULD BE SET LOCALLY, NOT NATIONALLY. BUT WE WILL 
MAKE NO CHANGE TO THE PRESENT SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING THE 
BUSINESS RATE WITHOUT FULL CONSULTATION WITH BUSINESS. 

 THE FUNNELLING OF GOVERNMENT GRANT TO CONSERVATIVE-CONTROLLED 
WESTMINSTER SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE CURRENT 
GRANT SYSTEM. LABOUR IS COMMITTED TO A FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF 
GOVERNMENT GRANT. 

 THE BASIC FRAMEWORK, NOT EVERY DETAIL, OF LOCAL SERVICE 
PROVISION MUST BE FOR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. COUNCILS SHOULD NOT 
BE FORCED TO PUT THEIR SERVICES OUT TO TENDER, BUT WILL BE REQUIRED 
TO OBTAIN BEST VALUE. WE REJECT THE DOGMATIC VIEW THAT SERVICES 
MUST BE PRIVATISED TO BE OF HIGH QUALITY, BUT EQUALLY WE SEE NO 
REASON WHY A SERVICE SHOULD BE DELIVERED DIRECTLY IF OTHER MORE 
EFFICIENT MEANS ARE AVAILABLE. COST COUNTS BUT SO DOES QUALITY. 

 EVERY COUNCIL WILL BE REQUIRED TO PUBLISH A LOCAL PERFORMANCE 
PLAN WITH TARGETS FOR SERVICE IMPROVEMENT, AND BE EXPECTED TO 
ACHIEVE THEM. THE AUDIT COMMISSION WILL BE GIVEN ADDITIONAL 
POWERS TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE AND PROMOTE EFFICIENCY. ON ITS 
ADVICE, GOVERNMENT WILL WHERE NECESSARY SEND IN A MANAGEMENT 
TEAM WITH FULL POWERS TO REMEDY FAILURE. 

 LABOUR COUNCILS HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
INITIATIVES UNDER LOCAL AGENDA 21, THE INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK 
FOR LOCAL ACTION ARISING FROM THE 1992 EARTH SUMMIT. A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT WILL ENCOURAGE ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ADOPT PLANS TO 
PROTECT AND ENHANCE THEIR LOCAL ENVIRONMENT. 

 LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS AT THE SHARP END OF THE FIGHT AGAINST 
DEPRIVATION. TEN YEARS AFTER THE CONSERVATIVES PROMISED TO 
IMPROVE THE INNER CITIES, POVERTY AND SOCIAL DIVISION AFFLICT TOWNS 
AND OUTER ESTATES ALIKE. A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL JOIN WITH LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT IN A CONCERTED ATTACK AGAINST THE MULTIPLE CAUSES OF 
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DECLINE - UNEMPLOYMENT, BAD HOUSING, 
CRIME, POOR HEALTH AND A DEGRADED ENVIRONMENT.

 LONDON 

 LONDON IS THE ONLY WESTERN CAPITAL WITHOUT AN ELECTED CITY 
GOVERNMENT. FOLLOWING A REFERENDUM TO CONFIRM POPULAR 
DEMAND, THERE WILL BE A NEW DEAL FOR LONDON, WITH A STRATEGIC 
AUTHORITY AND A MAYOR, EACH DIRECTLY ELECTED. BOTH WILL SPEAK UP 
FOR THE NEEDS OF THE CITY AND PLAN ITS FUTURE. THEY WILL NOT 
DUPLICATE THE WORK OF THE BOROUGHS, BUT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
LONDON-WIDE ISSUES - ECONOMIC REGENERATION, PLANNING, 
POLICING, TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. LONDON-WIDE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS OWN GOVERNMENT IS URGENTLY REQUIRED. WE 
WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN. 

 THE REGIONS OF ENGLAND 

 THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE CREATED A TIER OF REGIONAL GOVERNMENT IN 
ENGLAND THROUGH QUANGOS AND GOVERNMENT REGIONAL OFFICES. 
MEANWHILE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE COME TOGETHER TO CREATE A MORE 
CO-ORDINATED REGIONAL VOICE. LABOUR WILL BUILD ON THESE 
DEVELOPMENTS THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL CHAMBERS TO 
CO-ORDINATE TRANSPORT, PLANNING, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, BIDS FOR 
EUROPEAN FUNDING AND LAND USE PLANNING. 

 DEMAND FOR DIRECTLY ELECTED REGIONAL GOVERNMENT SO VARIES 
ACROSS ENGLAND THAT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO IMPOSE A UNIFORM 
SYSTEM. IN TIME WE WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE, 
REGION BY REGION, TO DECIDE IN A REFERENDUM WHETHER THEY WANT 
DIRECTLY ELECTED REGIONAL GOVERNMENT. ONLY WHERE CLEAR POPULAR 
CONSENT IS ESTABLISHED WILL ARRANGEMENTS BE MADE FOR ELECTED 
REGIONAL ASSEMBLIES. THIS WOULD REQUIRE A PREDOMINANTLY UNITARY 
SYSTEM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AS PRESENTLY EXISTS IN SCOTLAND AND 
WALES, AND CONFIRMATION BY INDEPENDENT AUDITORS THAT NO 
ADDITIONAL PUBLIC EXPENDITURE OVERALL WOULD BE INVOLVED. OUR 
PLANS WILL NOT MEAN ADDING A NEW TIER OF GOVERNMENT TO THE 
EXISTING ENGLISH SYSTEM. 

 REAL RIGHTS FOR CITIZENS 

 CITIZENS SHOULD HAVE STATUTORY RIGHTS TO ENFORCE THEIR HUMAN 
RIGHTS IN THE UK COURTS. WE WILL BY STATUTE INCORPORATE THE 
EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS INTO UK LAW TO BRING 
THESE RIGHTS HOME AND ALLOW OUR PEOPLE ACCESS TO THEM IN THEIR 
NATIONAL COURTS. THE INCORPORATION OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION 
WILL ESTABLISH A FLOOR, NOT A CEILING, FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. PARLIAMENT 
WILL REMAIN FREE TO ENHANCE THESE RIGHTS, FOR EXAMPLE BY A 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. 

 WE WILL SEEK TO END UNJUSTIFIABLE DISCRIMINATION WHEREVER IT 
EXISTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE, ENFORCEABLE 
CIVIL RIGHTS FOR DISABLED PEOPLE AGAINST DISCRIMINATION IN SOCIETY 
OR AT WORK, DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL INTERESTED PARTIES. 

 LABOUR WILL UNDERTAKE A WIDE-RANGING REVIEW BOTH OF THE REFORM 
OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND LEGAL AID. WE WILL ACHIEVE VALUE 
FOR MONEY FOR THE TAXPAYER AND THE CONSUMER. A COMMUNITY 
LEGAL SERVICE WILL DEVELOP LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL PLANS FOR 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL AID ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS AND 
PRIORITIES OF REGIONS AND AREAS. THE KEY TO SUCCESS WILL BE TO 
PROMOTE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR, THE LEGAL 
PROFESSION AND THE LEGAL AID BOARD. 

 EVERY COUNTRY MUST HAVE FIRM CONTROL OVER IMMIGRATION AND 
BRITAIN IS NO EXCEPTION. ALL APPLICATIONS, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE 
DEALT WITH SPEEDILY AND FAIRLY. THERE ARE, RIGHTLY, CRITERIA FOR 
THOSE WHO WANT TO ENTER THIS COUNTRY TO JOIN HUSBAND OR WIFE. 
WE WILL ENSURE THAT THESE ARE PROPERLY ENFORCED. WE WILL, 
HOWEVER, REFORM THE SYSTEM IN CURRENT USE TO REMOVE THE 
ARBITRARY AND UNFAIR RESULTS THAT CAN FOLLOW FROM THE EXISTING 
'PRIMARY PURPOSE' RULE. THERE WILL BE A STREAMLINED SYSTEM OF 
APPEALS FOR VISITORS DENIED A VISA. 

 THE SYSTEM FOR DEALING WITH ASYLUM SEEKERS IS EXPENSIVE AND 
SLOW - THERE ARE MANY UNDECIDED CASES DATING BACK BEYOND 
1993. WE WILL ENSURE SWIFT AND FAIR DECISIONS ON WHETHER 
SOMEONE CAN STAY OR GO, CONTROL UNSCRUPULOUS IMMIGRATION 
ADVISORS AND CRACK DOWN ON THE FRAUDULENT USE OF BIRTH 
CERTIFICATES.


 NORTHERN IRELAND 

 LABOUR'S APPROACH TO THE PEACE PROCESS HAS BEEN BIPARTISAN. WE 
HAVE SUPPORTED THE RECENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO 
GOVERNMENTS - THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT, THE DOWNING STREET 
DECLARATION AND THE FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT. THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
TABLED PROPOSALS WHICH INCLUDE A NEW DEVOLVED LEGISLATIVE BODY, 
AS WELL AS CROSS-BORDER CO-OPERATION AND CONTINUED DIALOGUE 
BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS. 

 THERE WILL BE AS GREAT A PRIORITY ATTACHED TO SEEING THAT PROCESS 
THROUGH WITH LABOUR AS UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES, IN CO-OPERATION 
WITH THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND PARTIES. WE 
WILL EXPECT THE SAME BIPARTISAN APPROACH FROM A CONSERVATIVE 
OPPOSITION. 

 WE WILL TAKE EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO COMBAT THE TERRORIST THREAT. 

 THERE IS NOW GENERAL ACCEPTANCE THAT THE FUTURE OF NORTHERN 
IRELAND MUST BE DETERMINED BY THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE AS SET 
OUT IN THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION. LABOUR RECOGNISES THAT 
THE OPTION OF A UNITED IRELAND DOES NOT COMMAND THE CONSENT OF 
THE UNIONIST TRADITION, NOR DOES THE EXISTING STATUS OF NORTHERN 
IRELAND COMMAND THE CONSENT OF THE NATIONALIST TRADITION. WE ARE 
THEREFORE COMMITTED TO RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO TRADITIONS 
AND TO A NEW POLITICAL SETTLEMENT WHICH CAN COMMAND THE SUPPORT 
OF BOTH. LABOUR WILL HELP BUILD TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AMONG BOTH 
NATIONALIST AND UNIONIST TRADITIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND BY ACTING 
TO GUARANTEE HUMAN RIGHTS, STRENGTHEN CONFIDENCE IN POLICING, 
COMBAT DISCRIMINATION AT WORK AND REDUCE TENSIONS OVER PARADES. 
LABOUR WILL ALSO FOSTER ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND COMPETITIVENESS 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND, SO AS TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT.

WE WILL GIVE BRITAIN LEADERSHIP IN EUROPE

 - REFERENDUM ON SINGLE CURRENCY 

 - LEAD REFORM OF THE EU 

 - RETAIN TRIDENT: STRONG DEFENCE 

 THROUGH NATO 

 - A REFORMED UNITED NATIONS 

 - HELPING TO TACKLE GLOBAL POVERTY

 BRITAIN, THOUGH AN ISLAND NATION WITH LIMITED NATURAL RESOURCES, 
HAS FOR CENTURIES BEEN A LEADER OF NATIONS. BUT UNDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES BRITAIN'S INFLUENCE HAS WANED. 

 WITH A NEW LABOUR GOVERNMENT, BRITAIN WILL BE STRONG IN 
DEFENCE; RESOLUTE IN STANDING UP FOR ITS OWN INTERESTS; AN 
ADVOCATE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY THE WORLD OVER; A 
RELIABLE AND POWERFUL ALLY IN THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF 
WHICH WE ARE A MEMBER; AND WILL BE A LEADER IN EUROPE. 

 OUR VISION OF EUROPE IS OF AN ALLIANCE OF INDEPENDENT NATIONS 
CHOOSING TO CO-OPERATE TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THEY CANNOT ACHIEVE 
ALONE. WE OPPOSE A EUROPEAN FEDERAL SUPERSTATE. 

 THERE ARE ONLY THREE OPTIONS FOR BRITAIN IN EUROPE. THE FIRST IS TO 
COME OUT. THE SECOND IS TO STAY IN, BUT ON THE SIDELINES. THE 
THIRD IS TO STAY IN, BUT IN A LEADING ROLE. 

 AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVES, OVERTLY OR COVERTLY, 
FAVOUR THE FIRST. BUT WITHDRAWAL WOULD BE DISASTROUS FOR BRITAIN. 
IT WOULD PUT MILLIONS OF JOBS AT RISK. IT WOULD DRY UP INWARD 
INVESTMENT. IT WOULD DESTROY OUR CLOUT IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
NEGOTIATIONS. IT WOULD RELEGATE BRITAIN FROM THE PREMIER DIVISION 
OF NATIONS. 

 THE SECOND IS EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE TODAY UNDER THE 
CONSERVATIVES. THE BSE FIASCO SYMBOLISES THEIR FAILURES IN 
EUROPE. 

 THE THIRD IS THE PATH A NEW LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE. A 
FRESH START IN EUROPE, WITH THE CREDIBILITY TO ACHIEVE REFORM. WE 
HAVE SET OUT A DETAILED AGENDA FOR REFORM, LEADING FROM THE FRONT 
DURING THE UK PRESIDENCY IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1998: 

 RAPID COMPLETION OF THE SINGLE MARKET: A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE 
BRITISH PRESIDENCY. WE WILL OPEN UP MARKETS TO COMPETITION; 
PURSUE TOUGH ACTION AGAINST UNFAIR STATE AIDS; AND ENSURE PROPER 
ENFORCEMENT OF SINGLE MARKET RULES. THIS WILL STRENGTHEN 
EUROPE'S COMPETITIVENESS AND OPEN UP NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
BRITISH FIRMS. 

 HIGH PRIORITY FOR ENLARGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO INCLUDE 
THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AND CYPRUS, AND THE 
INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS NECESSARY TO MAKE AN ENLARGED EUROPE WORK 
MORE EFFICIENTLY. 

 URGENT REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY. IT IS COSTLY, 
VULNERABLE TO FRAUD AND NOT GEARED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. 
ENLARGEMENT AND THE WORLD TRADE TALKS IN 1999 WILL MAKE 
REFORM EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL. WE WILL SEEK A THOROUGH OVERHAUL OF 
THE COMMON FISHERIES POLICY TO CONSERVE OUR FISH STOCKS IN THE 
LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF THE UK FISHING INDUSTRY. 

 GREATER OPENNESS AND DEMOCRACY IN EU INSTITUTIONS WITH OPEN 
VOTING IN THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND MORE EFFECTIVE SCRUTINY OF 
THE COMMISSION BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. WE HAVE LONG 
SUPPORTED A PROPORTIONAL VOTING SYSTEM FOR ELECTION TO THE 
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. 

 RETENTION OF THE NATIONAL VETO OVER KEY MATTERS OF NATIONAL 
INTEREST, SUCH AS TAXATION, DEFENCE AND SECURITY, IMMIGRATION, 
DECISIONS OVER THE BUDGET AND TREATY CHANGES, WHILE CONSIDERING 
THE EXTENSION OF QUALIFIED MAJORITY VOTING IN LIMITED AREAS WHERE 
THAT IS IN BRITAIN'S INTERESTS. 

 BRITAIN TO SIGN THE SOCIAL CHAPTER. AN 'EMPTY CHAIR' AT THE 
NEGOTIATING TABLE IS DISASTROUS FOR BRITAIN. THE SOCIAL CHAPTER IS 
A FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH LEGISLATIVE MEASURES CAN BE AGREED. 
ONLY TWO MEASURES HAVE BEEN AGREED - CONSULTATION FOR 
EMPLOYEES OF LARGE EUROPE-WIDE COMPANIES AND ENTITLEMENT TO 
UNPAID PARENTAL LEAVE. SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES ALREADY WORK 
CLOSELY WITH THEIR WORKFORCES. THE SOCIAL CHAPTER CANNOT BE 
USED TO FORCE THE HARMONISATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY OR TAX 
LEGISLATION AND IT DOES NOT COST JOBS. WE WILL USE OUR 
PARTICIPATION TO PROMOTE EMPLOYABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY, NOT HIGH 
SOCIAL COSTS. 

 THE SINGLE CURRENCY 

 ANY DECISION ABOUT BRITAIN JOINING THE SINGLE CURRENCY MUST BE 
DETERMINED BY A HARD-HEADED ASSESSMENT OF BRITAIN'S ECONOMIC 
INTERESTS. ONLY LABOUR CAN BE TRUSTED TO DO THIS: THE TORIES ARE 
RIVEN BY FACTION. BUT THERE ARE FORMIDABLE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF 
BRITAIN BEING IN THE FIRST WAVE OF MEMBERSHIP, IF EMU TAKES 
PLACE ON 1 JANUARY 1999. WHAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF 
EMU IS GENUINE CONVERGENCE AMONG THE ECONOMIES THAT TAKE 
PART, WITHOUT ANY FUDGING OF THE RULES. HOWEVER, TO EXCLUDE 
BRITISH MEMBERSHIP OF EMU FOREVER WOULD BE TO DESTROY ANY 
INFLUENCE WE HAVE OVER A PROCESS WHICH WILL AFFECT US WHETHER 
WE ARE IN OR OUT. WE MUST THEREFORE PLAY A FULL PART IN THE DEBATE 
TO INFLUENCE IT IN BRITAIN'S INTERESTS. 

 IN ANY EVENT, THERE ARE THREE PRE-CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE 
TO BE SATISFIED BEFORE BRITAIN COULD JOIN DURING THE NEXT 
PARLIAMENT: FIRST, 

 THE CABINET WOULD HAVE TO AGREE; THEN PARLIAMENT; AND FINALLY THE 
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO SAY 'YES' IN  A REFERENDUM. 

 STRONG DEFENCE THROUGH NATO 

 THE POST-COLD WAR WORLD FACES A RANGE OF NEW SECURITY 
CHALLENGES - PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, THE 
GROWTH OF ETHNIC NATIONALISM AND EXTREMISM, INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, AND CRIME AND DRUG TRAFFICKING. A NEW LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT WILL BUILD A STRONG DEFENCE AGAINST THESE THREATS. OUR 
SECURITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON NATO. 

 OUR ARMED FORCES ARE AMONG THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN THE WORLD. 
THE COUNTRY TAKES PRIDE IN THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND COURAGE. 
WE WILL ENSURE THAT THEY REMAIN STRONG TO DEFEND BRITAIN. BUT THE 
SECURITY OF BRITAIN IS BEST SERVED IN A SECURE WORLD, SO WE SHOULD 
BE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO WIDER INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY 
BOTH THROUGH THE ALLIANCES TO WHICH WE BELONG, IN PARTICULAR 
NATO AND THE WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION,  AND THROUGH OTHER 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE UN AND THE ORGANISATION 
FOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE. 

 LABOUR WILL CONDUCT A STRATEGIC DEFENCE AND SECURITY REVIEW TO 
REASSESS OUR ESSENTIAL SECURITY INTERESTS AND DEFENCE NEEDS. IT 
WILL CONSIDER HOW THE ROLES, MISSIONS AND CAPABILITIES OF OUR 
ARMED FORCES SHOULD BE ADJUSTED TO MEET THE NEW STRATEGIC 
REALITIES. THE REVIEW WE PROPOSE WILL BE FOREIGN POLICY LED, FIRST 
ASSESSING OUR LIKELY OVERSEAS COMMITMENTS AND INTERESTS AND 
THEN ESTABLISHING HOW OUR FORCES SHOULD BE DEPLOYED TO MEET 
THEM. 

 ARMS CONTROL 

 A NEW LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL RETAIN TRIDENT. WE WILL PRESS FOR 
MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS TOWARDS MUTUAL, BALANCED AND VERIFIABLE 
REDUCTIONS IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WHEN SATISFIED WITH VERIFIED 
PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR GOAL OF THE GLOBAL ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS, WE WILL ENSURE THAT BRITISH NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE 
INCLUDED IN MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS. 

 LABOUR WILL WORK FOR THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION AND FOR A STRENGTHENING OF THE 
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION. LABOUR WILL BAN THE IMPORT, 
EXPORT, TRANSFER AND MANUFACTURE OF ALL FORMS OF ANTI-PERSONNEL 
LANDMINES. WE WILL INTRODUCE AN IMMEDIATE MORATORIUM ON THEIR 
USE. LABOUR WILL NOT PERMIT THE SALE OF ARMS TO REGIMES THAT 
MIGHT USE THEM FOR INTERNAL REPRESSION OR INTERNATIONAL 
AGGRESSION. WE WILL INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
OF DECISIONS ON EXPORT LICENCES FOR ARMS. AND WE WILL SUPPORT AN 
EU CODE OF CONDUCT GOVERNING ARMS SALES. 

 WE SUPPORT A STRONG UK DEFENCE INDUSTRY, WHICH IS A STRATEGIC 
PART OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE AS WELL AS OUR DEFENCE EFFORT. WE 
BELIEVE THAT PART OF ITS EXPERTISE CAN BE EXTENDED TO CIVILIAN USE 
THROUGH A DEFENCE DIVERSIFICATION AGENCY. 

 LEADERSHIP IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 

 A NEW LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL USE BRITAIN'S PERMANENT SEAT ON 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO PRESS FOR SUBSTANTIAL REFORM OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS, INCLUDING AN EARLY RESOLUTION OF ITS FUNDING CRISIS, AND A 
MORE EFFECTIVE ROLE IN PEACEKEEPING, CONFLICT PREVENTION, THE 
PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SAFEGUARDING THE GLOBAL 
ENVIRONMENT. 

 THE COMMONWEALTH PROVIDES BRITAIN WITH A UNIQUE NETWORK OF 
CONTACTS LINKED BY HISTORY, LANGUAGE AND LEGAL SYSTEMS. LABOUR 
IS COMMITTED TO GIVING RENEWED PRIORITY TO THE COMMONWEALTH IN 
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. WE WILL SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE 
TRADE AND ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND WILL ALSO BUILD ALLIANCES 
WITH OUR COMMONWEALTH PARTNERS TO PROMOTE REFORM AT THE UN 
AND COMMON ACTION ON THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT. BRITAIN HAS A REAL 
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP TO THE COMMONWEALTH WHEN 
WE HOST THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING IN BRITAIN AT THE END OF 
1997.

 PROMOTING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 

 LABOUR WILL ALSO ATTACH MUCH HIGHER PRIORITY TO COMBATING GLOBAL 
POVERTY AND UNDERDEVELOPMENT. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD BANK, 
THERE ARE 1.3 BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO LIVE IN ABSOLUTE 
POVERTY, SUBSISTING ON LESS THAN US$1 A DAY, WHILE 35,000 
CHILDREN DIE EACH DAY FROM READILY PREVENTABLE DISEASES. 

 LABOUR BELIEVES THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP 
COMBAT GLOBAL POVERTY. IN GOVERNMENT WE WILL STRENGTHEN AND 
RESTRUCTURE THE BRITISH AID PROGRAMME AND BRING DEVELOPMENT 
ISSUES BACK INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF GOVERNMENT DECISION-MAKING. 
A CABINET MINISTER WILL LEAD A NEW DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT. 

 WE WILL SHIFT AID RESOURCES TOWARDS PROGRAMMES THAT HELP THE 
POOREST PEOPLE IN THE POOREST COUNTRIES. WE REAFFIRM THE UK'S 
COMMITMENT TO THE 0.7 PER CENT UN AID TARGET AND IN GOVERNMENT 
LABOUR WILL START TO REVERSE THE DECLINE IN UK AID SPENDING. 

 WE WILL WORK FOR GREATER CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE AID, TRADE, 
AGRICULTURE AND ECONOMIC REFORM POLICIES OF THE EU. WE WILL USE 
OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE EU TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE THE 
POSITION OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES DURING THE RENEGOTIATION OF THE 
LOMÉ CONVENTION. 

 WE WILL SUPPORT FURTHER MEASURES TO REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN 
BORNE BY THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES AND TO ENSURE THAT 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE GIVEN A FAIR DEAL IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE. 

 IT IS OUR AIM TO REJOIN UNESCO. WE WILL CONSIDER HOW THIS CAN 
BE DONE MOST EFFECTIVELY AND WILL ENSURE THAT THE COST IS MET FROM 
SAVINGS ELSEWHERE.

 HUMAN RIGHTS 

 LABOUR WANTS BRITAIN TO BE RESPECTED IN THE WORLD FOR THE 
INTEGRITY WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS. WE WILL 
MAKE THE PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS A CENTRAL PART 
OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY. WE WILL WORK FOR THE CREATION OF A 
PERMANENT INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT TO INVESTIGATE GENOCIDE, 
WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.

 A NEW ENVIRONMENTAL INTERNATIONALISM 

 LABOUR BELIEVES THAT THE THREATS TO THE GLOBAL CLIMATE SHOULD 
PUSH ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS HIGHER UP THE INTERNATIONAL AGENDA. 
A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL STRENGTHEN CO-OPERATION IN THE 
EUROPEAN UNION ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, INCLUDING CLIMATE 
CHANGE AND OZONE DEPLETION. WE WILL LEAD THE FIGHT AGAINST GLOBAL 
WARMING, THROUGH OUR TARGET OF A 20 PER CENT REDUCTION IN CARBON 
DIOXIDE EMISSIONS BY THE YEAR 2010. 

 LABOUR BELIEVES THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT SHOULD BE 
SAFEGUARDED IN NEGOTIATIONS OVER INTERNATIONAL TRADE. WE WILL ALSO 
WORK FOR THE SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATION OF A NEW PROTOCOL ON CLIMATE 
CHANGE TO BE COMPLETED IN JAPAN IN 1997.

 LEADERSHIP, NOT ISOLATION 

 THERE IS A SHARP DIVISION BETWEEN THOSE WHO BELIEVE THE WAY TO 
COPE WITH GLOBAL CHANGE IS FOR NATIONS TO RETREAT INTO ISOLATIONISM 
AND PROTECTIONISM, AND THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN INTERNATIONALISM AND 
ENGAGEMENT. LABOUR HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE PARTY OF 
INTERNATIONALISM. BRITAIN CANNOT BE STRONG AT HOME IF IT IS WEAK 
ABROAD. THE TRAGEDY OF THE CONSERVATIVE YEARS HAS BEEN THE 
SQUANDERING OF BRITAIN'S ASSETS AND THE LOSS OF BRITAIN'S 
INFLUENCE. 

 A NEW LABOUR GOVERNMENT WILL USE THOSE ASSETS TO THE FULL TO 
RESTORE BRITAIN'S PRIDE AND INFLUENCE AS A LEADING FORCE FOR GOOD 
IN THE WORLD. WITH EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP AND CLEAR VISION, BRITAIN 
COULD ONCE AGAIN BE AT THE CENTRE OF INTERNATIONAL DECISION-
MAKING INSTEAD OF AT ITS MARGINS. 

 THIS MANIFESTO CONTAINS THE DETAIL OF OUR PLANS. WE HAVE 
PROMISED ONLY WHAT WE KNOW WE CAN DELIVER.BRITAIN DESERVES 
BETTER AND THE FOLLOWING FIVE ELECTION PLEDGES WILL BE THE FIRST 
STEPS TOWARDS A BETTER BRITAIN. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP US BUILD 
THAT BETTER BRITAIN, JOIN US BY CALLING 0990 300 900.
