Progressive Unionist Party of Northern Ireland

PUP Home Page

A Reasonable Settlement.
* We are committed to the proposition that there will be no diminution of Northern Ireland?s position as an integral part of the United Kingdom whose paramount responsibility is the morale and physical well-being of all it?s citizens. 


Democratic Right.
* We defend the right of anyone or group to seek constitutional change by democratic, legitimate and peaceful means.
* We recognise and respect the rights and aspirations of all those who abide by the Law regardless of religious, cultural, national or political inclinations.
* There must be no dilution of the democratic procedure through which the rights of self-determination of the people of Northern Ireland are guaranteed.


A Constitution and Bill of Rights.
* We are dedicated to a Constitution and Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland containing stringent safeguards and mechanisms for protection of individuals, associations and minorities. 


An Honourable Society
* We are dedicated to an honourable and equitable society founded in democratic and accountable principles within which all of our people can play a constructive and meaning ful role without let or hindrance,



Co-operation.
* Structures could and should be devised whereby elected representatives, North and South, could voluntarily work to-gether, without interference in each other?s internal affairs, for the economic betterment and the fostering of good neighbourly relations between both parts of Ireland. 


A Solemn Undertaking.
* We give our solemn undertaking that never again in Northern Ireland will we willingly recognise or politically permit a return to the exclusive, divisive, abusive and corrosive political institutions of the past which were an affront to, and a blight on, the democratic embodiment and equitable concept of our Country. 


Conflict Transformation
* We believe that there must be a process of conflict transformation which restates the nature of our disagreements in a way which recognises the concerns of all parties.
* If the conflict can be transformed in this way it allows respect for diversity and a possibility of resolution, and is the necessary condition for the restoration of local autonomy, even if it may be impractical to resolve all differences. 


Economic Regeneration.
We have been to the fore in local regeneration and we will continue to 
* Encourage meaningful Training. programmes and the evolution of Community businesses.
* Develop and support trade missions
* Challenge the I.D.B. to encourage potential investors to come to high areas of unemployment.


Health and Social Services.
* We are unrelentingly opposed to any lowering of standards in regard to the sick and disadvantaged. In particular, we demand that patient care is based on medical needs and not made subject to profit motivation.
* We repudiate the values of the ?new? Right which has led to ?contract culture?in the provision of Health, Education and Social Welfare.


Education.
* We believe that education is a fundamental human right which Government is obligated to provide from pre-school to university level.
* We will work forcefully to make integrated education a real viable alternative for those parents and children who wish to avail themselves of it. 


Housing.
After witnessing at first hand the destruction of traditional communities in urban areas, the PUP, 
* Demand consultation in future housing development.
* Proper environmental concepts in future housing plans. 
* Open space amenities for local communities. 
* Consideration of appropriate planning methods for ?interface? areas based on community representation and participation. 


Women in Politics.
* We believe that Women have a equal role to play at all levels of political and social activity in the development of Northern Ireland and the Progressive Unionist Party encourages and welcomes the nomination and acceptance of Women as Party Delegates, Office Bearers and Candidates for election. 


The Disabled.
* We will be foremost in proposing and supporting any and all policies which will enable the disabled to play a full beneficial role in our society and to receive the practical assistance, understanding and recognition they richly deserve. 
* We feel that the subtle discrimination, and lack of provision, presently widespread in Northern Ireland regarding the disabled must cease forthwith. 


Community Politics.
The P.U.P. are wholly committed 
* To the development of peaceful community politics. 
* To educate where necessary. 
* To politicise universally.
* To promote participative democracy.
* To encourage community initiatives providing co-operative endeavours as alternatives to managerial social services and a profit-dominated market economy.


Public Transport.
* Our Party will work toward the provision of a sensible, efficient, public transport policy that will reflect the needs and requirements of the people we represent. 
* And for no restriction on the old, young, disabled or underprivileged in their desire to traverse the Province due to an inadequate transport policy. 


Security and Policing
* We call for the abolition of the Emergency Provisions Act.
* A re-structured Policing service to faithfully uphold the Law, defend the peace and protect the innocent.
* Police accountability will be a prime objective. 
* The formation of Community and Police liaison groups in genuine partnership.


Police Authority.
We will campaign for:
* A Police authority truly representative of our Society.
* A decisive Authority with clout.
* An Authority to whom the Police will be answerable and accountable.
* A fully independent Complaints Committee with full investigative powers.
* An Authority which will lay down guidelines for proper policing procedures.


The Illegal Drugs Trade.
Since the cease-fires the Illegal Drugs trade has become the biggest threat to our Society.
* We condemn all drug peddlers whoever they may be.
* We condemn the exploitation of the young and weak.
* We condemn the summary executions of drugs ?barons?.
* We call for the confiscation of all illegal drug money.
* We call on the RUC to vastly increase the Drugs Squad.
* We call on anyone with information about drugs to pass it to the RUC immediately.
* We call for intensive ?Drug Awareness? programmes in schools and youth centres.


The Prisoners.
* We call for an Amnesty and practical phased release of all political prisoners.
* A comprehensive Social Re-integration programme for returning prisoners.
* Financial provision to assist re-intregation.
* The abolition of social exclusion and discrimination which prevent prisoners from making a meaningful contribution towards political and community re-construction.
* Full National Insurance contributions to be attributed whilst in Prison and an end to other similar anamolies.
