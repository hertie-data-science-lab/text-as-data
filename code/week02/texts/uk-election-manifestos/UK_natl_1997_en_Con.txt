THE CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO 1997

FOREWORD
THE CONSERVATIVE ADMINISTRATIONS ELECTED SINCE 1979 ARE AMONG THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL IN BRITISH PEACETIME HISTORY. A COUNTRY ONCE THE SICK MAN OF EUROPE, 
HAS BECOME ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL ECONOMY. A COUNTRY ONCE BROUGHT TO ITS KNEES BY 
OVER MIGHTY POWERFUL TRADE UNIONS, NOW HAS INDUSTRIAL PEACE. ABROAD, THE COLD 
WAR HAS BEEN WON; AT HOME, THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN RESTORED.  THE ENTERPRISING 
VIRTUES OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LIBERATED FROM THE DEAD HAND OF THE 
STATE.  THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT WE HAVE CREATED A BETTER BRITAIN.  

WHY, THEN, DO WE STILL NEED A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT?  BECAUSE RESTING ON WHAT 
WE HAVE ACHIEVED IS NOT ENOUGH.  TO STAND STILL IS TO FALL BACK.  OUR GOAL MUST 
BE FOR BRITAIN TO BE THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO LIVE.

WE LIVE IN A TOUGHER, MORE UNCERTAIN WORLD.  A FAST-MOVING GLOBAL FREE MARKET IS 
EMERGING.  NEW ECONOMIC POWERS ARE RISING IN THE EAST.  FAMILY LIFE AND SOCIAL 
ATTITUDES ARE CHANGING.  EUROPE IS ADJUSTING TO THE END OF COMMUNISM.  THE 
EUROPEAN SOCIAL MODEL IS FAILING. THE NATION STATE IS UNDER THREAT.  WE MUST 
RESPOND TO THESE CHALLENGES.

WE HAVE TURNED AROUND OUR ECONOMIC FORTUNES.  WE HAVE FEWER PEOPLE OUT OF WORK 
AND MORE IN WORK THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR EUROPEAN ECONOMY.  BRITISH PEOPLE NOW HAVE 
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A PROSPEROUS FUTURE.  BUT THAT PROSPERITY CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR 
GRANTED.  WE HAVE TO COMPETE TO WIN.  THAT MEANS A CONSTANT FIGHT TO KEEP TIGHT 
CONTROL OVER PUBLIC SPENDING AND ENABLE BRITAIN TO REMAIN THE LOWEST TAXED MAJOR 
ECONOMY IN EUROPE.  IT MEANS A CONTINUING FIGHT TO KEEP BURDENS OFF BUSINESS, 
MAINTAINING OUR OPT-OUT OF THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL CHAPTER.  IF WE RELAX FOR ONE 
MOMENT, OUR HARD WON SUCCESS WILL SLIP AWAY AGAIN. 


WE HAVE STRENGTHENED CHOICE AND PERSONAL OWNERSHIP FOR FAMILIES, AND ROLLED BACK 
THE STATE FROM AREAS WHERE IT WAS INTERFERING UNNECESSARILY IN OUR LIVES.  BUT 
WE NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE A MASSIVE EXPANSION IN WEALTH AND 
OWNERSHIP SO THAT MORE FAMILIES CAN ENJOY THE SELF-RESPECT AND INDEPENDENCE THAT 
COMES WITH BEING SELF-SUFFICIENT FROM THE STATE.  OUR FAR-REACHING PROPOSALS FOR 
PERSONAL PENSION FUNDS ARE CENTRAL TO ACHIEVING THIS - SO TOO ARE OUR PLANS TO 
INCREASE SUPPORT FOR THE FAMILY IN OUR TAX SYSTEM.  OUR AIM IS TO SPREAD 
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL TO SUCCEED, WHOEVER THEY ARE AND WHEREVER THEY COME FROM, 
PROVIDED THEY ARE PREPARED TO WORK HARD.  TO TURN THE "HAVE NOTS" INTO THE 
"HAVES".  TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY IN PROVIDING SECURITY AND STABILITY.

WE HAVE MODERNISED AND REFORMED MANY OF THE AREAS WHERE THE STATE STILL HAS A 
VITAL ROLE.  BUT WE NOW HAVE TO BUILD ON THESE REFORMS TO DELIVER EVEN BETTER 
SERVICES. WE MUST CONTINUE PROVIDING THE RESOURCES TO INVEST IN OUR MODERNISED 
HEALTH SERVICE.  WE CAN NOW PROVIDE PARENTS WITH A HARD-EDGED GUARANTEE OF 
STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS.  WE NEED ALSO TO WIDEN CHOICE IN AREAS WHERE STATE 
BUREAUCRACY HAS CONSTRAINED IT. 

WE HAVE PIONEERED NEW WAYS OF BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS THAT ENGAGE THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR IN AREAS PREVIOUSLY DEPENDENT ON THE PUBLIC PURSE.  WE NOW NEED TO 
CAPTURE PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT ON A MASSIVE SCALE TO REGENERATE OUR CITIES, 
TRANSFORM OUR CRUMBLING LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSING ESTATES AND MODERNISE OTHER 
PUBLIC ASSETS.

THE ONLY WAY TO SECURE THIS FUTURE OF OPPORTUNITY IS TO STICK WITH THE 
CONSERVATIVE PROGRAMME OF CONTINUING REFORM.  NOW WOULD BE THE WORST POSSIBLE 
MOMENT TO ABANDON THE PATHWAY TO PROSPERITY ON WHICH WE ARE SET.  WE MUST KEEP 
UP THE MOMENTUM.

AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST MAINTAIN THE SECURITY THAT A STABLE NATION PROVIDES IN 
AN UNCERTAIN, FAST CHANGING WORLD.  WE MUST PROTECT OUR CONSTITUTION AND UNITY 
AS A NATION FROM THOSE WHO THREATEN IT WITH UNNECESSARY AND DANGEROUS CHANGE.  
AND WE MUST STAND UP FOR OUR INTERESTS IN SHAPING A FREE-MARKET EUROPE OF 
SOVEREIGN NATION STATES.  

THERE IS, OF COURSE, AN ALTERNATIVE ON OFFER:  TO LOAD COSTS ON BUSINESS WHILE 
CALLING IT "STAKEHOLDING";  TO INCREASE THE ROLE OF THE STATE, WHILE CALLING IT 
"THE COMMUNITY";  TO SUCCUMB TO A CENTRALISED EUROPE WHILE CALLING IT "NOT BEING 
ISOLATED";  TO BREAK UP OUR COUNTRY WHILE CALLING IT "DEVOLUTION".  

TO RISK THIS ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR OUR COUNTRY.  WE HAVE COME A 
VERY LONG WAY.  WE MUST BE SURE THAT WE DO NOT THROW AWAY WHAT WE HAVE GAINED, 
OR LOSE THE OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE EARNED.  

YOU CAN ONLY BE SURE WITH THE CONSERVATIVES.


OUR VISION FOR BRITAIN

THE ENTERPRISE CENTRE OF EUROPE

1.	DOUBLING LIVING STANDARDS
2.	JOBS AND BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITY AND OWNERSHIP FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES
3.	CHOICE AND SECURITY FOR FAMILIES
4.	EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITY

WORLD CLASS HEALTH AND PUBLIC SERVICES
5.	SECURITY IN HEALTH
6.	BETTER PUBLIC SERVICES

A SAFE AND CIVIL SOCIETY
7.	LAW, ORDER AND SECURITY

A CONFIDENT, UNITED AND SOVEREIGN NATION
8.	THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO LIVE
9.	EUROPE AND THE WORLD
10.	THE CONSTITUTION

A CHOICE OF TWO FUTURES














	THE ENTERPRISE CENTRE OF EUROPE


OUR RECORD - ENTERPRISE

*	THE UK IS ON COURSE TO GROW FASTER THAN BOTH FRANCE AND GERMANY FOR THE 
SIXTH SUCCESSIVE YEAR IN 1998 - A POST-WAR RECORD.

*	INFLATION HAS NOW BEEN BELOW 4% FOR WELL OVER 4 YEARS, THE LONGEST PERIOD 
OF LOW INFLATION FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY.

*	MORTGAGE RATES ARE AT THEIR LOWEST LEVELS FOR 30 YEARS.

*	UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL FOR 6 YEARS.  WE NOW HAVE A 
LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR EUROPEAN ECONOMY.  YOUTH 
UNEMPLOYMENT IN BRITAIN HAS FALLEN TO LESS THAN 15% WHEREAS BY CONTRAST, IN 
FRANCE IT HAS RISEN TO 27% AND IN ITALY TO 33%.

* 	A HIGHER PROPORTION OF OUR PEOPLE ARE IN WORK THAN IN ANY OTHER MAJOR 
EUROPEAN ECONOMY - 68% AGAINST A CONTINENTAL AVERAGE OF 57%.
 
*	THE UK IS THE FAVOURITE LOCATION FOR INWARD INVESTMENT INTO EUROPE, 
ATTRACTING AROUND ONE THIRD OF INWARD INVESTMENT INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION.

*	WE HAVE THE LOWEST TAX BURDEN OF ANY MAJOR EUROPEAN ECONOMY, WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT TAKING ALMOST 8% LESS OF NATIONAL INCOME THAN THE EUROPEAN AVERAGE. 

* 	PUBLIC BORROWING HAS AVERAGED 3.4% OF GDP SINCE 1979 COMPARED WITH 6.8% 
(AND A PEAK OF 9.5%) UNDER THE LAST LABOUR GOVERNMENT.  OUR LEVEL OF PUBLIC DEBT 
IS NOW ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE EUROPEAN UNION - WHEREAS IT WAS ONE OF THE 
HIGHEST IN 1979. 

*	IN 1994 THE UK LOST 300,000 WORKING DAYS THROUGH STRIKES, THE LOWEST 
FIGURE EVER RECORDED;  IN 1979 THE FIGURE WAS 29,500,000:  NEARLY 100 TIMES THAT  
FIGURE.

*	BRITAIN RANKS FIFTH IN THE WORLD IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE, AND EXPORTS MORE 
PER HEAD THAN AMERICA OR JAPAN.  EXPORTS ACCOUNT FOR 28% OF GDP AS AGAINST 9% 
FOR JAPAN, 11% FOR USA AND 24% FOR GERMANY AND FRANCE.  BRITAIN'S CURRENT 
ACCOUNT IS BROADLY IN BALANCE, REFLECTING OUR INCREASED COMPETITIVENESS AND 
IMPROVED TRADING.


1.	DOUBLING LIVING STANDARDS

THE FREE MARKET IS WINNING THE BATTLE OF IDEAS THE WORLD OVER.  FROM RUSSIA TO 
VIETNAM, FROM CHINA TO ROMANIA, PEOPLE ARE REALISING THAT THE SOCIALIST MODEL 
HAS FAILED.  THIS IS NOT JUST AN ECONOMIC TRIUMPH.  IT IS A TRIUMPH FOR HUMAN 
FREEDOM.
BRITAIN HELPED TO SECURE IT.  WE SHOULD TAKE PRIDE IN IT.

THE SPREAD OF THE FREE MARKET HERALDS A NEW AGE OF GLOBAL COMPETITION.  THAT 
MEANS NEW MARKETS FOR BRITISH GOODS AND SERVICES, BUT NEW COMPETITORS FOR 
BRITISH COMPANIES AS WELL.

IF WE TRY TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THESE CHALLENGES WITH MORE REGULATIONS, 
PUBLIC SUBSIDIES AND A COSY DEPENDENCE ON GOVERNMENT THEN BRITAIN WILL FAIL.  
BUT IF WE BOLDLY EMBRACE THESE NEW OPPORTUNITIES BY PUSHING FORWARD THE ECONOMIC 
REVOLUTION WE BEGAN IN 1979, THEN WE WILL ENTER THE NEXT MILLENNIUM WITH 
BOUNDLESS PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH AND PROSPERITY.

THAT CHOICE - BETWEEN STAGNATION AND DYNAMISM - IS THE CHOICE WHICH FACES 
BRITAIN AT THIS ELECTION.  IT IS A STARK CHOICE BETWEEN THE BRITISH WAY - OF 
TRUSTING THE PEOPLE AND UNLEASHING ENTERPRISE - AND THE FAILING SOCIAL MODEL, 
PRACTISED ON THE CONTINENT, WHICH THE LABOUR PARTY WANTS TO IMPOSE ON US HERE 
UNDER THE GUISE OF "STAKEHOLDING".

HARD ECONOMIC EVIDENCE SHOWS HOW GREAT IS THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THESE TWO 
STRATEGIES.  BRITAIN IS NOW IN ITS FIFTH YEAR OF GROWING FASTER THAN FRANCE OR 
GERMANY.  UNEMPLOYMENT IN BRITAIN HAS FALLEN TO LESS THAN TWO MILLION, WHILE IT 
RISES ACROSS EUROPE.  BRITAIN ATTRACTS NEARLY FORTY PER CENT OF ALL THE AMERICAN  
AND JAPANESE INVESTMENT IN EUROPE.  OUR AIM NOW IS TO SAFEGUARD THESE 
ACHIEVEMENTS AND BUILD ON THEM, SO BRITAIN BECOMES THE UNRIVALLED ENTERPRISE 
CENTRE OF EUROPE.

A LOW TAX ECONOMY
FOR ENTERPRISE TO FLOURISH, THE STATE MUST GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE WEALTH 
CREATORS.  WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY THAT CAN CUT TAXES BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONLY 
PARTY WHICH IS SERIOUS ABOUT CONTROLLING PUBLIC SPENDING.  THE CHOICE BETWEEN 
THE TWO ECONOMIC PHILOSOPHIES IS CLEAR.  IN THE YEARS BEFORE 1979, PUBLIC 
SPENDING IN BRITAIN KEPT PACE WITH THE AVERAGE FOR EUROPE AS A WHOLE.  SINCE 
THEN, IT HAS CONTINUED RISING ON THE CONTINENT, WHILE WE HAVE RESTRAINED PUBLIC 
SPENDING HERE.  NOW, PUBLIC SPENDING  TAKES ABOUT 40% OF OUR NATIONAL INCOME AS 
AGAINST AN AVERAGE OF 50% ON THE CONTINENT.  WE HAVE BROKEN FREE FROM A TREND IN 
WHICH THE REST OF EUROPE IS STILL TRAPPED.  

CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL KEEP PUBLIC SPENDING UNDER TIGHT CONTROL AND ENSURE 
THAT IT GROWS BY LESS THAN THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE OVER THE ECONOMIC CYCLE.  AT 
THE SAME TIME WE WILL CONTINUE TO SPEND MORE ON THE SERVICES WHICH MATTER MOST 
TO PEOPLE - HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS AND THE POLICE.  

	OVER THE NEXT PARLIAMENT, WE WILL ACHIEVE OUR GOAL FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO 
SPEND LESS THAN 40% OF OUR NATIONAL INCOME.

THAT MEANS WE CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT GOVERNMENT BORROWS TOO, AND MEET OUR AIM OF 
MOVING TOWARDS A BALANCED BUDGET IN THE MEDIUM TERM.  OUR PLANS SHOW HOW WE CAN 
VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE PUBLIC BORROWING BY THE YEAR 2000.

THANKS TO OUR SUCCESS IN CONTROLLING PUBLIC SPENDING, BRITAIN IS NOW EUROPE'S 
LOW TAX ECONOMY.  THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ARE BECOMING THE ENTERPRISE 
CENTRE OF EUROPE.
	OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE BRITAIN KEEPS THE LOWEST TAX BURDEN OF ANY MAJOR 
EUROPEAN ECONOMY.

IN THE ELECTION MANIFESTO OF 1992, WE PROMISED THAT "WE WILL MAKE FURTHER 
PROGRESS  TOWARDS A BASIC INCOME TAX RATE OF 20P".  SINCE THEN, WE HAVE CUT THE 
BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX FROM 25P TO 23P, AND EXTENDED THE 20P BAND SO THAT OVER 
A QUARTER OF ALL TAXPAYERS NOW ONLY PAY INCOME TAX AT THE 20P RATE.  ACHIEVING 
OUR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE GOALS WILL MEAN WE CAN  SUSTAIN PERMANENTLY LOW TAX 
LEVELS.

	OVER THE NEXT PARLIAMENT, OUR AIM WILL BE TO ACHIEVE OUR TARGET OF A 20P 
BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX, WHILE MAINTAINING A MAXIMUM TAX RATE OF NO MORE THAN 
40P.

STABLE PRICES
INFLATION HAS TO BE KEPT FIRMLY UNDER CONTROL FOR AN ECONOMY TO THRIVE.  BRITAIN 
IS NOW ENJOYING THE LONGEST PERIOD OF STABLE PRICES FOR ALMOST FIFTY YEARS.  WE 
ARE ON TARGET TO REACH OUR GOAL OF 21/2% INFLATION THIS YEAR.  

LOW INFLATION HAS DELIVERED LOWER INTEREST RATES WHILST PRESERVING THE VALUE OF 
PEOPLE'S SAVINGS.  HOMEOWNERS ARE NOW ENJOYING MORTGAGE RATES AT THE LOWEST 
LEVELS FOR 30 YEARS.

IT HAS TAKEN TOUGH DECISIONS TO BREAK FREE FROM OUR REPUTATION AS A HIGH 
INFLATION ECONOMY. NO CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL JEOPARDISE THIS ACHIEVEMENT.  

	DURING THE NEXT PARLIAMENT, WE WILL MAINTAIN AN INFLATION TARGET OF 21/2% 
OR LESS.
RISING LIVING STANDARDS
THE ONLY SECURE BASE FOR RISING LIVING STANDARDS IS A STRONGLY GROWING ECONOMY, 
LOW LEVELS OF PUBLIC SPENDING AND TAXATION, AND STABLE PRICES.  THAT IS EXACTLY 
WHAT BRITAIN IS ACHIEVING.  PEOPLE ARE REAPING THE REWARDS OF THEIR HARD WORK AS 
THEIR TAKE HOME PAY INCREASES.  BETWEEN 1974 AND 1979, THE TAKE HOME PAY FOR A 
FAMILY  ON AVERAGE EARNINGS ROSE, IN REAL TERMS, BY JUST (POUND)1 A WEEK IN 
TODAY'S PRICES.  SINCE 1979 IT HAS INCREASED BY (POUND)100 A WEEK AND; THIS YEAR 
ALONE IT WILL INCREASE BY (POUND)7 A WEEK.

	THE GOAL WHICH WE SET OURSELVES IN 1995 IS TO DOUBLE LIVING STANDARDS OVER 
25 YEARS.  

WE ARE ON COURSE TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL.





2.	JOBS AND BUSINESS

OUR PRIORITY IS TO CREATE JOBS.  THIS IS NOT JUST AN ECONOMIC PRIORITY, BUT ALSO 
A SOCIAL AND MORAL ONE.  JOBS AND ENTERPRISE ARE THE BEST WAYS OF TACKLING 
POVERTY AND DEPRIVATION.

BRITAIN IS SUCCEEDING.  900,000 JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS.  
BY CONTRAST THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL MODEL IS STIFLING JOB CREATION ON THE CONTINENT 
BY IMPOSING REGULATIONS AND BURDENS ON BUSINESS.  IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS MUCH LOWER THAN IN THE REST OF EUROPE AND FALLING WHEREAS IN 
GERMANY, FRANCE, AND ITALY IT HAS RISEN TO ITS HIGHEST LEVEL FOR A GENERATION.  
THIS IS NO ACCIDENT.  IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE PURSUED VERY DIFFERENT POLICIES FROM 
THOSE ON THE CONTINENT.

CURBING THE POWER OF TRADE UNIONS, OPENING UP MARKETS AND CUTTING RED TAPE, HAVE 
GIVEN US A LOW STRIKE, LOW COST ECONOMY:  AND AS A RESULT WE ARE THE NUMBER ONE 
LOCATION FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN EUROPE.  

NEVER HAVE SUCH POLICIES BEEN SO IMPORTANT.  FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS CENTURY WE 
FACE A WORLD FULL OF CAPITALIST COMPETITION.  THE ONLY WAY BRITAIN WILL BE ABLE 
TO COMPETE AND WIN IN WORLD MARKETS IS BY STICKING TO THE CONSERVATIVE POLICIES 
THAT ARE DELIVERING SUCCESS.  WE CAN EARN PROSPERITY AS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST 
SUCCESSFUL GLOBAL TRADING NATIONS.  WE SHOULD NOT RISK THIS PROGRESS BY ADOPTING 
THE VERY POLICIES THAT HAVE MADE THE CONTINENT UNCOMPETITIVE AND HAVE INCREASED 
UNEMPLOYMENT IN EUROPE BY 4.5 MILLION OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS.

SMALL BUSINESSES - BRITAIN'S RISK-TAKERS
GOVERNMENTS DO NOT CREATE JOBS.  BUSINESSES DO.  THE SOURCE OF TOMORROW'S JOBS 
WILL BE SMALL BUSINESSES, THE SEEDCORN OF BRITAIN'S PROSPERITY.  OVER THE LAST 
15 YEARS, SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE CREATED OVER 2 MILLION JOBS.  BY THE YEAR 2000, 
OVER HALF THE WORKFORCE SHOULD BE WORKING IN COMPANIES WHICH EMPLOY FEWER THAN 
50 PEOPLE.  BACK IN 1979 ONLY A THIRD OF THE WORKFORCE DID.

ENTREPRENEURS OFTEN RISK EVERYTHING WHEN THEY SET UP THEIR OWN BUSINESS.  WE 
HAVE ALREADY HELPED THEM:  RAISING THE VAT THRESHOLD, CUTTING EMPLOYER'S 
NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS, SIMPLIFYING AUDIT REQUIREMENTS AND MUCH MORE 
BESIDES.  NOW WE INTEND TO GO FURTHER, TACKLING THE REMAINING PROBLEMS THEY 
FACE.  

HIGH TAXES AND RATES DETER ENTERPRISE.  OUR LOW TAX STRUCTURE HAS BEEN CRUCIAL 
TO OUR INDUSTRIAL REVIVAL.  WE ALREADY HAVE THE LOWEST CORPORATION TAX OF ANY 
MAJOR INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRY.  AS WE WANT SMALL BUSINESSES TO FLOURISH, WE WILL 
GO EVEN FURTHER.  

WE WILL CUT THE SMALL COMPANIES RATE OF CORPORATION TAX IN LINE WITH PERSONAL 
TAXATION AS WE MOVE TOWARDS A 20P BASIC RATE.  

INVESTMENT AND ENTERPRISE ARE DETERRED IF THE TAX MAN TAKES TOO MUCH OF THE 
CAPITAL THAT IS BUILT UP BY A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.  CAPITAL IS EVER MORE MOBILE, 
FLYING AROUND THE WORLD TO PLACES WHERE THE TAX ON IT IS LOW:  BRITAIN MUST BE 
ONE OF THOSE PLACES.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND INHERITANCE TAX 
AS IT IS PRUDENT TO DO SO.

ONE OF THE HEAVIEST BURDENS SMALL BUSINESSES FACE IS BUSINESS RATES.  AT THE 
MOMENT, THIS BEARS MORE HEAVILY UPON SMALL BUSINESSES THAN LARGE ONES.  

IN THE NEXT PARLIAMENT, WE WILL REFORM BUSINESS RATES TO REDUCE THE COST THAT 
FALLS UPON SMALL BUSINESSES.

NO BUSINESSMAN HAS TIME TO FILL OUT REAMS OF FORMS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
SIMPLIFY THE ADMINISTRATION OF NICS AND PAYE FOR SMALL FIRMS, ALLOWING THEM TO 
CONCENTRATE ON SATISFYING CUSTOMERS NOT BUREAUCRATS.  WE ARE ALSO TACKLING A 
PROBLEM THAT HITS SMALL BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY HARD - THE LATE PAYMENT OF 
BILLS.  ON TOP OF OUR PROGRAMME TO ENSURE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES PAY ON TIME WE HAVE LEGISLATED TO REQUIRE COMPANIES TO PUBLISH THEIR 
PAYMENT POLICY AND TO REPORT THEIR RECORD ON HOW QUICKLY THEY PAY THEIR BILLS TO 
SMALL BUSINESSES.

WE HAVE ALREADY ABOLISHED OVER A THOUSAND REGULATIONS.  NEW REGULATIONS MUST 
ONLY BE INTRODUCED IF IT IS CLEAR THAT THEIR BENEFITS EXCEED THEIR COSTS AND 
THEY DO NOT PLACE AN UNDUE BURDEN ON A SMALL FIRM.  

WE WILL INTRODUCE "SUNSET" REQUIREMENTS INTO NEW REGULATIONS WHENEVER IT IS 
SUITABLE SO THAT THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY REVIEWED OR DROPPED AFTER A SPECIFIC 
PERIOD.  

MANY BUSINESSMEN SUFFER REGULATORY BURDENS IMPOSED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND 
QUANGOS.

WE WILL THEREFORE INSIST THAT THE WHOLE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR ADOPTS THE SAME 
STRINGENT RULES THAT WE REQUIRE OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN JUSTIFYING THE BENEFITS 
OF NEW REGULATIONS AGAINST THEIR COSTS.

REDUCING THE BURDEN ON COMPANIES
JOBS DEPEND ON BRITISH FIRMS WINNING ORDERS:  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCCESS OR 
FAILURE CAN BE WAFER THIN.  ANY EXTRA BURDEN ON BUSINESS WILL DESTROY JOBS.  

BRITAIN IS ENJOYING MORE JOBS AND RECORD INVESTMENT, THANKS TO THE COMPETITIVE 
EDGE WE HAVE OVER OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  WE ARE A LOW COST ECONOMY.  BUT 
THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE A LOW PAY ECONOMY.  OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE COMES 
FROM THE LOWER COSTS FACING OUR BUSINESSES.  IT CAN BE MEASURED BY THE SOCIAL 
COSTS AN EMPLOYER HAS TO PAY ON TOP OF EVERY (POUND)100 OF WAGES:  IN GERMANY IT 
IS (POUND)31, IN FRANCE (POUND)41, BUT IN BRITAIN, IT IS ONLY (POUND)15.

MANY COUNTRIES IN EUROPE HAVE TRIED TO COCOON THEMSELVES FROM GLOBAL COMPETITION 
BEHIND LAYERS OF RED TAPE AND REGULATION - SUCH AS THE SOCIAL CHAPTER AND A 
NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE.  THIS PROVIDES A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY, PLAYING A CRUEL 
TRICK ON WORKING PEOPLE.  IT ALSO EXCLUDES THE UNEMPLOYED FROM WORK.  AS 
COMPANIES IN THE REST OF EUROPE HAVE GROWN MORE UNCOMPETITIVE, EMPLOYERS HAVE 
FOUND IT TOO EXPENSIVE TO EMPLOY NEW WORKERS, INVESTMENT HAS GONE ELSEWHERE, AND 
THE DOLE QUEUES HAVE LENGTHENED.  THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL MODEL IS NOT SOCIAL AND 
NOT A MODEL FOR US TO FOLLOW.  BUT IF BRITAIN SIGNED UP TO THE SOCIAL CHAPTER IT 
WOULD BE USED TO IMPOSE THAT MODEL ON US - DESTROYING BRITISH JOBS.

NO CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL SIGN UP TO THE SOCIAL CHAPTER OR INTRODUCE A 
NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE.  WE WILL INSIST AT THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE IN 
AMSTERDAM THAT OUR OPT OUT IS HONOURED AND THAT BRITAIN IS EXEMPTED FROM THE 
WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE:  IF OLD AGREEMENTS ARE BROKEN, WE DO NOT SEE HOW NEW 
ONES CAN BE MADE.

WE WILL RESIST THE IMPOSITION OF OTHER SOCIAL BURDENS ON THE WORK PLACE THROUGH 
A NEW EUROPEAN EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER.

WELFARE INTO WORK
ALTHOUGH GOVERNMENTS CANNOT CREATE JOBS, THEY CAN HELP PEOPLE TRAIN AND FIND 
WORK.  WE NOW HAVE IN PLACE A BATTERY OF SCHEMES WORKING WITH TRAINING AND 
ENTERPRISE COUNCILS TO PROVIDE TARGETED HELP AND TRAINING, INCLUDING REMEDIAL 
EDUCATION IN LITERACY AND NUMERACY.  WE ARE ALSO DEVELOPING NEW INCENTIVES, 
ALONGSIDE FAMILY CREDIT, TO HELP PEOPLE MOVE OFF BENEFIT INTO WORK.

WE WILL ALWAYS HELP THOSE IN GENUINE NEED: IN RETURN, THE UNEMPLOYED HAVE A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK FOR WORK AND ACCEPT A REASONABLE OFFER.  THAT BELIEF 
UNDERPINS OUR NEW JOBSEEKERS ALLOWANCE WHICH ENSURES THAT NO-ONE CAN REFUSE 
REASONABLE WORK OPPORTUNITIES AND REMAIN ON BENEFIT.

AS UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS, WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR 
SOME TIME.  AT PRESENT,  PROJECT WORK IS HELPING 100,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
UNEMPLOYED FOR MORE THAN 2 YEARS IN CITIES AROUND BRITAIN.  THEY ARE FIRST GIVEN 
HELP IN FINDING A JOB - WHICH INCLUDES GIVING EMPLOYERS INCENTIVES TO TAKE THEM 
ON.  THOSE WHO DO NOT FIND JOBS ARE THEN REQUIRED TO WORK FOR A SPECIFIC PERIOD 
ON A COMMUNITY PROJECT.  THIS HELPS THEM REGAIN WORK HABITS AND ENSURES THEY ARE 
AVAILABLE FOR WORK.

AS  PROJECT WORK SUCCEEDS AND DEMONSTRATES THAT ITS COSTS CAN BE MET BY THE 
SAVINGS FROM GETTING PEOPLE INTO WORK, WE WILL EXTEND THE PROGRAMME TO COVER THE 
LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED NATIONWIDE.

WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE "BRITAIN WORKS" SCHEME WHICH USES THE 
EXPERIENCE AND INGENUITY OF PRIVATE AND VOLUNTARY SECTORS TO GET PEOPLE OFF 
WELFARE INTO WORK.

BRITAIN HAS ONE OF THE MOST MOBILE ECONOMIES IN EUROPE.  PEOPLE MOVE ON AND UP, 
INTO BETTER PAID JOBS MORE EASILY THAN ON THE CONTINENT.

THE INFORMATION SOCIETY
BRITAIN IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF CREATING TOMORROW'S INFORMATION SOCIETY.  ALREADY 
WE HAVE EXPOSED DOMESTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO COMPETITION AND STIMULATED 
INVESTMENT IN CABLE AND SATELLITE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS.  AND BY OPENING UP 
INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE COMPANIES 
WORLDWIDE TO BASE THEIR GLOBAL OPERATIONS HERE.  WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE 
DIGITAL REVOLUTION COMES TO BRITAIN FIRST.  

WE ARE LAUNCHING AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAMME WITH INDUSTRY TO SPREAD "IT FOR ALL", 
GIVING EVERY ADULT THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY OUT AND LEARN ABOUT NEW IT SERVICES.  
WE WILL WORK WITH INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT ALL SCHOOLS ARE CONNECTED TO THE 
INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY.  

WE WILL USE THE MILLENNIUM LOTTERY FUND TO TRANSFORM THE COMPUTER FACILITIES AND 
INFORMATION LINKS AVAILABLE IN SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES, MUSEUMS, VOLUNTARY 
ORGANISATIONS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES AFTER THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.  

THIS WILL GIVE THE PUBLIC MUCH WIDER ACCESS TO INFORMATION SERVICES IN THE YEARS 
AHEAD.  WE WILL ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO TRANSFORM THE 
WAY GOVERNMENT PROVIDES SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC.  

WE WILL KEEP BRITAIN IN THE VANGUARD OF NEW MOBILE SERVICE DEVELOPMENT - 
INCLUDING MOBILE TELEPHONE AND INFORMATION SERVICES - BY INTRODUCING A PRICING 
SYSTEM FOR THE RADIO SPECTRUM TO ACHIEVE MORE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF RADIO 
FREQUENCIES.  

WE WILL MAINTAIN A STRONG, FREE AND COMPETITIVE BROADCASTING AND PRESS 
ENVIRONMENT AT BOTH NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL, WHILE CONTINUING TO BE VIGILANT IN 
MONITORING WHETHER ACTION IS NEEDED TO CURB BREACHES OF STANDARDS, AND PREVENT 
UNACCEPTABLE PRESS INTRUSION.  

SCIENCE
BRITISH SCIENCE ENJOYS A WORLDWIDE REPUTATION FOR EXCELLENCE AND COST-
EFFECTIVENESS, WHICH MAKES BRITAIN AN ATTRACTIVE BASE FOR MANY DOMESTIC AND 
OVERSEAS COMPANIES.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SCIENCE AND TARGET FUNDS AT 
BASIC RESEARCH, WHICH WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE FUNDED BY INDUSTRY. AT THE SAME 
TIME WE WILL PROVIDE AN ENTERPRISING ENVIRONMENT WHICH ENCOURAGES FIRMS TO 
INVEST WITH CONFIDENCE IN APPLIED SCIENCE.

2020 VISION
THERE IS NO PART OF THE GLOBE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN REACHED BY BRITISH ENTERPRISE 
AND BRITISH CULTURE.  WE HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED OUT BEYOND THESE SHORES, BEYOND THIS 
CONTINENT.  OUR LANGUAGE, OUR HERITAGE OF INTERNATIONAL TRADING LINKS, OUR 
FOREIGN INVESTMENTS - SECOND ONLY TO AMERICA'S - ARE HISTORIC STRENGTHS WHICH 
MEAN WE ARE IDEALLY PLACED TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

THANKS TO CONSERVATIVE POLICIES OF LIBERALISATION AND PRIVATISATION WE ARE 
STRONG IN INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE SUCH AS TELECOMMUNICATIONS, FINANCIAL 
SERVICES, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.  THESE ARE THE INDUSTRIES THAT WILL 
BENEFIT FROM OPENING UP TRADE AROUND THE WORLD.  WE WILL PUSH FOR COMPLETION OF 
THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET AND CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE OBJECTIVE OF TRANSATLANTIC 
FREE TRADE AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF WORLD TRADE LIBERALISATION.

OUR AIM IS NOTHING LESS THAN TARIFF FREE TRADE ACROSS THE GLOBE BY THE YEAR 
2020.

FREE COMPETITION IS IMPORTANT FOR FREE MARKETS.  COMPANIES SHOULD NOT MAKE 
AGREEMENTS THAT RESTRICT COMPETITION AND HENCE RESULT IN POOR VALUE FOR 
CONSUMERS.  WE HAVE SET OUT PROPOSALS TO GIVE COMPANIES GREATER PROTECTION 
AGAINST PRICE FIXING, DUMPING, AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES BY LARGER 
COMPETITORS.   

WE WILL INTRODUCE A COMPETITION BILL TO TAKE FORWARD THESE PROPOSALS IN THE 
FIRST SESSION OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO PUSHING FORWARD OUR COMPETITIVENESS AGENDA WHICH IS MAKING 
BRITAIN THE ENTERPRISE CENTRE OF EUROPE.

OPPORTUNITY AND OWNERSHIP FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES


OUR RECORD - OPPORTUNITY

*	THE RIGHT TO BUY HAS ALLOWED 1.5 MILLION COUNCIL TENANTS TO BECOME 
HOMEOWNERS. THERE ARE OVER 4 MILLION MORE HOMEOWNERS TODAY THAN IN 1979.

*	THE GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT (POUND)6 BILLION THROUGH HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS TO 
PROVIDE HOMES FOR RENT.  BETWEEN 1992 AND 1995 HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS PROVIDED 
178,000 NEW LETTINGS - 25,000 MORE THAN PROMISED IN THE 1992 MANIFESTO. 

* 	THERE ARE NOW AROUND 10 MILLION PRIVATE SHAREHOLDERS, UP FROM ABOUT 3 
MILLION AT THE TIME OF THE LAST LABOUR GOVERNMENT.  2.5  MILLION PEOPLE NOW HAVE 
TAX FREE SAVINGS IN PEP ACCOUNTS, AND 4.5 MILLION IN TESSAS.

* 	SINCE 1979, THE SUCCESS OF PRIVATE PENSION PROVISION HAS RAISED THE 
AVERAGE INCOME OF PENSIONERS BY 60% MORE THAN INFLATION. ALMOST 90% OF RECENTLY 
RETIRED PENSIONERS NOW HAVE INCOMES OVER AND ABOVE STATE BENEFITS.

* 	SAVINGS IN PRIVATE PENSION FUNDS HAVE INCREASED TO (POUND)650 BILLION - 
MORE THAN 4 TIMES THE LEVEL IN 1979. THEIR VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE PENSION 
FUNDS IN ALL OTHER EU COUNTRIES ADDED TOGETHER. 

*	OVER THE PERIOD 1979 TO 1995, EDUCATION SPENDING PER PUPIL ROSE FROM 
(POUND)515 TO (POUND)1,890 - AN INCREASE IN REAL TERMS OF 48%.  REAL SPENDING ON 
BOOKS AND EQUIPMENT PER PUPIL ROSE 56%.  TEACHERS' REAL PAY ROSE 57%:  FROM 
(POUND)270 PER WEEK IN 1979 TO (POUND)420 IN 1995.

*	IN 1979, 40% OF THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS ATTENDED NURSERY SCHOOL;  IN 1995 
THE FIGURE WAS 59%.  OUR NURSERY VOUCHERS NOW GIVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY 
CHILD.

*	THE PROPORTION OF SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS STAYING ON IN FULL-TIME EDUCATION ROSE 
FROM 4 OUT OF 10 IN 1979 TO 7 OUT OF 10 IN 1995.  

*	ALMOST 1 IN 3 YOUNG PEOPLE NOW GO TO UNIVERSITY, COMPARED WITH 1 IN 8 IN 
1979.

*	THE PROPORTION OF ADULTS WITH NO ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS HAS HALVED SINCE 
1979 AND THE PROPORTION OF ADULTS WITH A DEGREE OR EQUIVALENT HAS MORE THAN 
DOUBLED RISING FROM 5% TO 12%.


3.	CHOICE AND SECURITY FOR FAMILIES

THE FAMILY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTION IN OUR LIVES.  IT OFFERS SECURITY 
AND STABILITY IN A FAST-CHANGING WORLD.  BUT THE FAMILY IS UNDERMINED IF 
GOVERNMENTS TAKE DECISIONS WHICH FAMILIES OUGHT TO TAKE FOR THEMSELVES.  SELF-
RELIANCE UNDERPINS FREEDOM AND CHOICE.  

FAMILIES ARE STRONGER IF THEY HAVE THE MONEY TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES:  THAT IS 
WHY WE ARE SHIFTING POWER AND WEALTH BACK TO WORKING FAMILIES AND AWAY FROM THE 
STATE.  WE HAVE ALREADY ACHIEVED MUCH - THE AVERAGE FAMILY'S DISPOSABLE INCOME 
HAS GONE UP BY 40% SINCE 1979.  BUT WE WANT TO GO FURTHER.  THE NEXT 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO REFORM THE TAX SYSTEM SO THAT IT GIVES 
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE HELP TO FAMILIES.  

WE ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SAVE SO THEY HAVE THE SECURITY AND SELF-
RESPECT THAT COMES FROM BEING ABLE TO RELY ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES RATHER THAN 
IMMEDIATELY TURNING TO THE STATE.  WE HAVE ALREADY MADE MUCH PROGRESS HERE TOO 
WITH WIDENING OWNERSHIP OF HOMES, PENSIONS, AND THE NEW PEPS AND TESSAS.  WE NOW 
PROPOSE FURTHER RADICAL MEASURES FOR MORE SAVING FOR RETIREMENT.

FAMILIES AND TAX
WE BELIEVE FAMILIES SHOULD BE LEFT WITH AS MUCH OF THEIR OWN MONEY AS POSSIBLE.  
THEY KNOW BETTER THAN POLITICIANS HOW TO SPEND IT.  WE HAVE ALREADY CUT THE 
BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX FROM 33P TO 23P, AND OUR AIM IS TO GET IT DOWN TO 20P, 
BENEFITING 18 MILLION TAXPAYERS.  WE INTEND TO DO EVEN MORE TO HELP FAMILIES IN 
PARTICULAR.


AT THE MOMENT, IF ONE SPOUSE DOES NOT TAKE PAID WORK IN ORDER TO LOOK AFTER 
CHILDREN OR DEPENDENT RELATIVES, THEY NOT ONLY GIVE UP EARNINGS BUT MAY ALSO BE 
UNABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THEIR PERSONAL TAX ALLOWANCE.  YET THIS IS THE TIME AT 
WHICH THEIR INCOME IS OFTEN MOST STRETCHED.

WE BELIEVE OUR TAX SYSTEM SHOULD RECOGNISE AND SUPPORT THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF 
FAMILIES IN THEIR CARING RESPONSIBILITIES.  WE WILL GIVE THEM THAT SUPPORT.

	WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO FUTURE REDUCTIONS IN PERSONAL TAXATION THAT HELP  
FAMILIES LOOKING AFTER DEPENDENT CHILDREN OR RELATIVES BY ALLOWING ONE PARTNER'S 
UNUSED PERSONAL ALLOWANCE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A WORKING SPOUSE WHERE  THEY HAVE 
THESE RESPONSIBILITIES.

THIS WILL PROVIDE A TARGETED REDUCTION IN THE TAX BILL TO THOSE FAMILIES WHO 
NEED IT MOST.  AROUND 2 MILLION ONE TAXPAYER COUPLES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN, OR 
LOOKING AFTER ELDERLY RELATIVES AND OTHERS NEEDING CARE, WOULD GAIN UP TO 
(POUND)17.50 A WEEK - AROUND (POUND)900 A YEAR.

FAMILY SAVINGS
IN THE OLD DAYS PEOPLE JUST DEPENDED ON THE WEEKLY PAY PACKET OR MONEY FROM THE 
STATE.  BUT NO JOB CAN BE SECURE AND THE STATE CANNOT PROVIDE FOR EVERY 
EVENTUALITY.  IT IS OWNERSHIP WHICH BRINGS TRUE SECURITY AND GENUINE 
INDEPENDENCE FROM THE STATE.  THAT IS WHY CONSERVATIVES HAVE LONG DREAMED OF A 
PROPERTY-OWNING DEMOCRACY.  NOW WE ARE DELIVERING IT IN PRACTICE.  HOME 
OWNERSHIP IS UP BY 4.7 MILLION.  10 MILLION PEOPLE OWN A DIRECT PERSONAL STAKE 
IN OUR ECONOMY.  16 MILLION ARE GAINING SHARES IN THEIR BUILDING SOCIETIES 
THANKS TO OUR DEREGULATION OF THEM.  WE INTEND TO CARRY FORWARD OUR VISION OF A 
PEOPLE'S SHARE.   THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PERSONAL SECURITY.  IT IS 
THE CONSERVATIVE VISION OF SECURITY THROUGH PERSONAL SAVINGS - NOT A SOCIALIST 
VISION OF SECURITY THROUGH THE STATE.


WE WANT PEOPLE TO ENJOY BRITAIN'S SUCCESS - ESPECIALLY BY OWNING SHARES IN THE 
COMPANIES FOR WHICH THEY WORK.  WE HAVE ALREADY INTRODUCED A NUMBER OF SCHEMES 
TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP.  TO ENCOURAGE A FURTHER  EXPANSION OF 
WORKER SHARES, OUR NEW SHARE MATCH SCHEME WILL ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO BE REWARDED 
WITH ADDITIONAL FREE SHARES IF THEY ACQUIRE A STAKE IN THEIR COMPANY.

	OUR GOAL IS THAT BY 2000, MORE THAN HALF OF THE EMPLOYEES OF BRITAIN'S 
LARGER COMPANIES WILL OWN SHARES IN THOSE COMPANIES.

41/2 MILLION PEOPLE NOW BENEFIT FROM TAX FREE TESSAS AND 2.5 MILLION FROM PEP 
SCHEMES TO ENCOURAGE THE ACCUMULATION OF LONG TERM SAVING.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
BUILD ON THIS SUCCESS BY EXPLORING WAYS IN WHICH EXISTING TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR 
SAVINGS CAN BE DEVELOPED  -  ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO SECURE THEIR FUTURES AND 
PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES AGAINST UNEXPECTED CONTINGENCIES.

	WE WILL CONTINUE TO RAISE THE THRESHOLD FOR INHERITANCE TAX AS IT PRUDENT 
TO DO SO.

PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST SAVING FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND GRAND-
CHILDREN.  THESE SAVINGS SHOULD NOT BE PENALISED BY THE TAX SYSTEM.

FOR MANY PEOPLE THEIR BIGGEST ASSET IS THEIR PENSION.  THANKS TO THE STEPS WE 
HAVE ALREADY TAKEN TO ENCOURAGE OCCUPATIONAL AND PERSONAL PENSIONS, WE NOW HAVE 
(POUND)650 BILLION INVESTED IN PRIVATE PENSIONS - MORE THAN THE REST OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION PUT TOGETHER.  WE NOW PLAN TO BUILD FURTHER ON THIS ACHIEVEMENT.

	WE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS TO SET UP PERSONAL PENSION 
PLANS FOR GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES.
  
	WE WILL CREATE MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO SAVE IN PERSONAL PENSION 
PLANS TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN THOSE SCHEMES IF THEY SUBSEQUENTLY MOVE TO JOBS 
WITH COMPANY PENSION SCHEMES.  

	WE WILL ALSO CREATE FLEXIBILITY FOR EMPLOYEES WITH SAVINGS IN ADDITIONAL 
VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS (AVC) SCHEMES TO TAKE PART OF THAT PENSION EARLIER OR 
LATER THAN THEIR MAIN COMPANY PENSION.

BUT WE BELIEVE THE TIME HAS NOW COME TO PLAN FOR ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP IN 
IMPROVING BRITAIN'S PENSION PROVISION.  BRITAIN IS ALREADY MUCH BETTER PLACED 
THAN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES TO AFFORD STATE PENSIONS IN THE FUTURE, BUT WE WANT 
EVEN MORE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK FORWARD TO A PROPERLY FUNDED PENSION THAT 
GROWS WITH THE ECONOMY AND IS FREE FROM DEPENDENCE ON TAXES PAID BY FUTURE 
GENERATIONS.  WE NOW PROPOSE A PRACTICAL WAY OF ACHIEVING A GRADUAL 
TRANSFORMATION OF THE STATE PENSION SCHEME.

	AT THE START OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT WE WILL SET OUT PROPOSALS TO PROVIDE 
ALL YOUNG PEOPLE ENTERING THE WORKFORCE WITH A PERSONAL PENSION FUND PAID FOR 
THROUGH A REBATE ON THEIR NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS.  AT RETIREMENT THEY 
WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THE FULL PENSION EARNED BY THIS ACCUMULATED INVESTMENT.  
THIS COULD GIVE THEM A PENSION SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THEY WOULD CURRENTLY 
RECEIVE FROM THE STATE.  BUT THEY WITH BE GUARANTEED A PENSION AT LEAST EQUAL TO 
THE CURRENT BASIC STATE PENSION, INCREASED IN LINE WITH INFLATION.

THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE STATE PENSION 
SYSTEM SINCE IT WAS INTRODUCED.

OLDER PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN THE WORKFORCE WOULD BE UNAFFECTED - THEY WILL CONTINUE 
TO CONTRIBUTE AS NOW AND RECEIVE THE NORMAL STATE PENSION WHEN THEY RETIRE.  

THIS POLICY WOULD COME INTO EFFECT EARLY IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM.  GRADUAL PHASING 
IN OF THE NEW SYSTEM OVER 40 YEARS WILL MAKE THE IMPACT ON PUBLIC FINANCES 
AFFORDABLE.  EVEN AT ITS PEAK, THE NET REVENUE FORGONE WILL BE ONLY A FRACTION 
OF THE SAVINGS FROM THE RECENT PENSIONS ACT.  AND EVENTUALLY, THE NEW POLICY  
WILL PRODUCE MASSIVE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SAVINGS.  

THIS FAR-SIGHTED IDEA IS IN THE BEST CONSERVATIVE TRADITION.  THE GROWING WEALTH 
OF THE NATION WILL PROVIDE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION THROUGH PRIVATE FUNDING, 
UNDERPINNED BY A STATE GUARANTEE.  BRITISH PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK FORWARD 
TO RETIREMENT WITH EVEN GREATER CONFIDENCE.  AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WILL HAVE A 
PENSIONS OPPORTUNITY UNRIVALLED IN THE WORLD.

SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES
CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE THAT A HEALTHY SOCIETY ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO ACCEPT 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN LIVES.  A HEAVY-HANDED AND INTRUSIVE STATE CAN DO 
ENORMOUS DAMAGE.

SOME FAMILIES NEED HELP TO COPE WITH THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.  FOR THEM, SOCIAL 
SERVICES PLAY A VITAL ROLE.  THEY HELP WITH CHILDREN WHERE PARENTAL CARE HAS 
FAILED.  THEY DELIVER AN EVER WIDER RANGE OF SERVICES TO PEOPLE WITH LEARNING 
DIFFICULTIES OR WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL.  OUR COMMUNITY CARE REFORMS HAVE GIVEN 
THEM A CENTRAL ROLE ENSURING THAT ELDERLY PEOPLE GET CARE OF THE HIGHEST 
QUALITY:  AND IN THEIR OWN HOMES WHERE POSSIBLE.  WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ROLE IS 
PROPERLY FULFILLED.

EARLY IN THE NEXT PARLIAMENT WE WILL INTRODUCE A SOCIAL SERVICES REFORM BILL 
WHICH WILL CREATE A NEW STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR SOCIAL SERVICES.  THE BILL WILL 
PROVIDE FOR GREATER OPENNESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN SOCIAL SERVICES.

	WE WILL PROVIDE NEW GUIDANCE TO ENSURE SOCIAL WORKERS PROPERLY REFLECT THE 
VALUES OF THE COMMUNITY - FOCUSING THEIR EFFORTS ON THOSE FAMILIES WHO MOST NEED 
SUPPORT, AND MINIMISING UNNECESSARY INTERFERENCE.  SOCIAL WORKERS WORKING WITH 
CHILDREN WILL RECEIVE SPECIAL TRAINING TO COPE WITH THE OFTEN HEART-RENDING 
CASES THEY FACE.

	WE WILL RAISE STANDARDS THROUGH A NEW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WHICH WILL 
APPLY THE SAME STANDARDS IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR.

	WE WILL ALSO REMOVE THE POWER OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO OPERATE CARE HOMES 
WHERE THIS IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE.

WE BELIEVE THAT FAMILIES WHO USE SOCIAL SERVICES SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXERCISE 
CHOICE WHEREVER PRACTICABLE.  WE HAVE GIVEN CASH PAYMENTS TO DISABLED PEOPLE TO 
PURCHASE THE SERVICES THEY NEED DIRECTLY.

WE ALSO WANT NEW WAYS OF REINFORCING INDIVIDUAL CHOICE WHERE POSSIBLE.  WE WILL 
THEREFORE ENSURE NO BARRIERS STAND IN THE WAY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES WANTING TO 
ISSUE THEIR USERS WITH VOUCHERS TO BUY CERTAIN SERVICES.

	WE WILL REVIEW THE DIRECT PAYMENT SCHEME, AND PROVIDED IT HAS BEEN COST 
EFFECTIVE, WE WILL EXTEND IT TO OTHER USERS OF SOCIAL SERVICES.

ABOVE ALL, WE WANT TO HELP FAMILIES TO HELP THEMSELVES.  CARING FOR OLDER - OR 
DISABLED - RELATIVES IS ONE OF THE MOST NATURAL HUMAN INSTINCTS.  WE RECOGNISE 
THE CRUCIAL - AND OFTEN DEMANDING - ROLE CARERS PLAY, AND WILL HELP THEM MORE. 

	WE WILL INTRODUCE A RESPITE CARE PROGRAMME.  THIS WILL ENABLE FAMILY 
MEMBERS WITH HEAVY RESPONSIBILITIES CARING FOR A RELATIVE TO TAKE A MUCH NEEDED 
BREAK.  WE WILL ALSO OFFER MORE PRACTICAL ADVICE FOR CARERS WHO WANT TO GO BACK 
TO PAID WORK.

BUT IN SOME CASES, ELDERLY PEOPLE NEED MORE CARE THAN THEIR FRIENDS OR RELATIVES 
CAN PROVIDE.  FINANCING LONG TERM CARE WORRIES MANY FAMILIES.  WE WILL CREATE AN 
IMAGINATIVE, FAIR PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO 
RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

	IN THE FIRST SESSION OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT WE WILL IMPLEMENT OUR 
PARTNERSHIP SCHEME FOR LONG TERM CARE, MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO AFFORD THE 
COST OF CARE IN OLD AGE WITHOUT GIVING UP THEIR LIFETIME SAVINGS.

GOOD PREPARATION FOR MARRIAGE CAN BE AN IMPORTANT AID TO A SUCCESSFUL FAMILY, 
WHILE TIMELY HELP IN MEETING DIFFICULTIES CAN OFTEN AVOID FAMILY BREAKDOWN.  
THESE ARE MATTERS FOR VOLUNTARY EFFORT, NOT THE STATE, BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
SUPPORT SUCH EFFORT.

WE NEED TO MAKE SURE EFFORTS TO HELP STRUGGLING FAMILIES DOES NOT TURN INTO 
UNNECESSARY MEDDLING.

WHEN THE STATE GOES TOO FAR, IT IS OFTEN THE CHILDREN WHO SUFFER.  THEY BECOME 
VICTIMS OF THE WORST SORT OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.

	WE WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO REMOVE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO ADOPTION 
AND INTRODUCE NEW RULES TO MAKE ADOPTION FROM ABROAD MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD.

	WE WILL ALSO MONITOR THE WORKINGS OF THE CHILDREN ACT, AND ACT IF 
NECESSARY TO ENSURE IT MAINTAINS A PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN 
AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF ADULTS.



SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS ARE NOW THE FOURTH ARM OF THE WELFARE STATE.  MOST 
PEOPLE WILL NEED THEM AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIVES.  WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE 
CONSERVATIVE REVOLUTION IN PUBLIC SERVICES NOW REACHES SOCIAL SERVICES.

DISABLED PEOPLE
WE HAVE QUADRUPLED REAL SPENDING ON LONG TERM SICK AND DISABLED PEOPLE SINCE 
1979, TO (POUND)22 BILLION.

WE HAVE INTRODUCED THE DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT.  THIS IS THE FIRST 
LEGISLATION OF ITS KIND ANYWHERE IN EUROPE AND IT PROVIDES POSITIVE PROOF OF OUR 
COMMITMENT TO DISABLED PEOPLE.  WE WILL MONITOR IT TO ENSURE IT CONTINUES TO 
MEET ITS OBJECTIVES.

WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING A CONTINUING FUND TO SUPPORT THE MOST SEVERELY DISABLED 
PEOPLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES.

SECURITY IN RETIREMENT
PENSIONERS CONTINUE TO MAKE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY IN RETIREMENT.  
THEY GIVE MORE OF THEIR TIME IN CHARITABLE WORK THAN ANY OTHER AGE GROUP.  THEY 
LIFT SOME OF THE PRESSURES ON THEIR OWN FAMILIES.  THEY HELP KEEP OUR NATION'S 
HISTORY AND TRADITIONS ALIVE.  

THEY HAVE PAID THEIR NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES AND RIGHTLY 
EXPECT US TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF THE BASIC STATE PENSION AGAINST 
PRICE RISES.  WE WILL DO SO.  WE WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT LESS WELL OFF PENSIONERS 
CONTINUE TO GET EXTRA HELP ON TOP OF THE BASIC PENSION.  

AT THE SAME TIME AS PROTECTING THE STATE PENSION, OUR ENCOURAGEMENT OF PRIVATE 
PENSIONS IS ALREADY TRANSFORMING THE LIVING STANDARDS OF PENSIONERS.  THE 
AVERAGE NET INCOME OF PENSIONERS HAS RISEN BY 60% SINCE 1979. THIS HAS BEEN 
ACHIEVED BY  OUR ENCOURAGEMENT OF SAVING FOR RETIREMENT. 

THE TAX SYSTEM MUST HELP PENSIONERS WHO HAVE SAVED.  OUR NEW LOWER 20P RATE ON 
INCOME FROM SAVINGS DIRECTLY HELPS 1.7 MILLION PENSIONERS AND THE SPECIAL AGE 
ALLOWANCES RAISE THE POINT AT WHICH PENSIONERS START TO PAY INCOME TAX.  

A BETTER SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM
PEOPLE IN NEED CAN RELY ON OUR CONTINUING SUPPORT.  AND TO ENSURE THAT TAXPAYERS 
ARE WILLING TO GO ON PAYING FOR THAT SUPPORT, WE HAVE SHAPED A SOCIAL SECURITY 
SYSTEM WE CAN AFFORD, TAKING A STEADILY DECLINING SHARE OF OUR NATIONAL INCOME.  
WE ARE DOING THIS BY FOCUSING BENEFITS ON THOSE MOST IN NEED, HELPING PEOPLE OFF 
WELFARE AND INTO WORK, AND CURBING WELFARE FRAUD.  THESE POLICIES ARE 
UNDERPINNED BY OUR MEASURES TO HELP FAMILIES HELP THEMSELVES.

SOCIAL SECURITY MUST BE THERE TO HELP FAMILIES, PENSIONERS AND PEOPLE IN NEED.  
WE WILL PROTECT THE VALUE OF CHILD BENEFIT AND FAMILY CREDIT WHICH HELP WITH THE 
COST OF BRINGING UP CHILDREN.  THIS IS OUR FAMILY BENEFITS GUARANTEE.

WE WILL BRING THE STRUCTURE OF BENEFITS FOR LONE PARENTS INTO LINE WITH THAT FOR 
TWO-PARENT FAMILIES.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO HELP LONE PARENTS OBTAIN MAINTENANCE, 
AND ASSIST WITH CHILDCARE IN WORK:  BOTH THESE MEASURES HELP LONE PARENTS OBTAIN 
WORK.  WE WILL PILOT OUR "PARENT PLUS" SCHEME THAT GIVES SPECIAL HELP TO LONE 
PARENTS WHO WANT TO WORK, AND EXTEND IT AS IT PROVES SUCCESSFUL.

SOCIAL SECURITY FRAUD MUST BE STAMPED OUT.

	WE WILL INTENSIFY OUR CURRENT INITIATIVES OF INSPECTIONS AND CHECKS 
INCLUDING MORE HOME VISITS, TO CRACK DOWN FURTHER ON BENEFIT CHEATS.   WE WILL 
INTRODUCE BENEFIT CARDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  WE WILL ESTABLISH A BENEFIT FRAUD 
INSPECTORATE TO MONITOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES' PERFORMANCE.  WE WILL ALSO IMPROVE 
THE SHARING OF INFORMATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO CATCH MORE 
FRAUDULENT CLAIMS.

TO ENSURE AS MUCH OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET AS POSSIBLE GOES INTO BENEFITS, 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF ADMINISTRATION, USING THE BEST MIX 
OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR OPERATIONS.

HOUSING
OWNING ONE'S OWN HOME IS AN AIM SHARED BY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.  OVER THE LAST 18 
YEARS, THE NUMBER OF HOMEOWNERS HAS INCREASED BY 4.7 MILLION - INCLUDING 1.7 
MILLION WHO HAVE BROUGHT THEIR HOME UNDER THE RIGHT TO BUY SCHEME.  OVER THE 
NEXT 10 YEARS, WE EXPECT TO SEE ABOUT ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE BUYING THEIR 
OWN HOMES - SOME 3,000 EVERY WEEK.  TO MEET THAT DEMAND, WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
ALLOW LOCAL AUTHORITY AND HOUSING ASSOCIATION TENANTS TO BUY THEIR HOMES OR MOVE 
TO HOUSES WHICH THEY BUY. 

	WE WILL ALSO CARRY THROUGH OUR DRAFT BILL, CREATING THE OPTION FOR THOSE 
BUYING FLATS TO CHOOSE A NEW FORM OF COMMONHOLD OWNERSHIP.

FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO RENT THEIR HOME, WE ARE ENCOURAGING A THRIVING PRIVATE 
RENTAL MARKET, BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF HOUSING INVESTMENT TRUSTS AND 
PROTECTING ASSURED TENANCIES.  

EASIER RENTING WILL HELP US MEET OUR TARGET OF REDUCING THE PROPORTION OF EMPTY 
HOMES BELOW 3%.  THE NUMBER OF EMPTY HOUSES HAS FALLEN IN EACH OF THE LAST 3 
YEARS.  BUT NOTHING IS MORE FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED SOCIAL HOUSING THAN 
THE SIGHT OF A SUITABLE PROPERTY OWNED BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR LYING BOARDED UP AND 
EMPTY.  WE WILL STOP THAT.

	PUBLIC LANDLORDS WILL HAVE TO SELL HOUSES WHICH ARE AVAILABLE FOR 
OCCUPATION YET HAVE BEEN LEFT EMPTY WITHOUT A GOOD REASON FOR MORE THAN 12 
MONTHS.  

HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS AND HOUSING COMPANIES WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HELP IN 
BUILDING NEW HOMES, AND WE WILL ENCOURAGE MORE PUBLIC - PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS.  
TOGETHER, THESE POLICIES WILL HELP MEET THE DEMAND FOR NEW PUBLIC HOUSING AND 
MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE DECENT HOMES FOR THOSE IN NEED.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
WOMEN ARE SUCCEEDING IN BRITAIN.  MORE WOMEN HAVE JOBS IN BRITAIN THAN IN ALMOST 
ANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRY. WOMEN HAVE A BETTER EDUCATION, MORE FINANCIAL 
INDEPENDENCE AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN BRITAIN'S HISTORY. 

THIS SUCCESS REFLECTS THE EFFORTS AND DETERMINATION OF MANY WOMEN. GOVERNMENT'S 
ROLE HAS BEEN SIMPLER - TO LEVEL UP THE PLAYING FIELD, WHETHER IN EDUCATION, 
WHERE GIRLS ARE NOW DOING BETTER THAN BOYS, OR IN THE WORKPLACE, WHERE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN ARE THE BEST IN EUROPE. 

BUT WE KNOW OUR JOB IS NOT YET DONE. SOME WOMEN STILL FACE BARRIERS TO DOING 
WELL. SOME STILL DO NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL SECURITY THEY DESERVE. AND CRIME, AND 
THE FEAR OF CRIME, OFTEN AFFECT WOMEN MORE THAN MEN.

WE WILL ENSURE WOMEN HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN EDUCATION AND THE WORKPLACE. 
THIS CAN BEST BE ACHIEVED BY KEEPING OUR ECONOMY BUOYANT AND OUR LABOUR MARKETS 
FLEXIBLE. AND OUR PROPOSALS TO BRING CRIME RATES DOWN FURTHER WILL HELP WOMEN 
ESPECIALLY.

BUT MANY WOMEN - AND SOME MEN  - FACE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM: HOW TO JUGGLE JOB 
AND FAMILY.  FOR THOSE WHO NEED OR WANT TO WORK, WE WILL SEEK FURTHER WAYS TO 
MINIMISE THE BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE, HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE. FOR THOSE WHO WISH 
TO BE FULL-TIME PARENTS, OUR PROPOSALS TO ENABLE THEM TO TRANSFER THEIR UNUSED 
PERSONAL ALLOWANCE TO THEIR SPOUSE WILL BE WORTH UP TO AN EXTRA (POUND)17.50 A 
WEEK.
 
WE ALSO WANT TO GIVE WOMEN MORE FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE, PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY 
RETIRE. WE PROPOSE, AS EXPLAINED ELSEWHERE, TO IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY IN SAVING FOR 
RETIREMENT AND TO ALLOW COURTS TO SPLIT PENSIONS ON DIVORCE.
   
LOOKING OUTWARDS
THE SPREAD OF SHARE OWNERSHIP, THE TRANSFORMATION OF PENSION PROVISION, AND THE 
SALE OF COUNCIL HOUSES ARE REVOLUTIONISING OUR NATION.  PERSONAL PROSPERITY AND 
PROPERTY OWNERSHIP ARE NOT SELFISH OR INWARD-LOOKING.  

PEOPLE WHO ARE SECURE AT HOME CAN LOOK OUT FOR OTHERS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. OVER 
TWO THIRDS OF ADULTS ENGAGE IN SOME FORM OF VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY.  BY THE END OF 
1997 ALL YOUNG PEOPLE AGED BETWEEN 15 AND 25 WHO WANT TO VOLUNTEER WILL BE 
HELPED TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY WORK BY OTHERS LIVING ON BENEFIT WHILE CONTINUING TO 
INSIST THAT THOSE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF WORK SHOULD ACTIVELY SEEK EMPLOYMENT. WE 
WILL ALSO DEVELOP ACCREDITATION FOR VOLUNTARY WORK TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO SEE 
IT AS PREPARATION FOR A PAID JOB.

WE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR THOSE RECEIVING INCAPACITY BENEFIT TO VOLUNTEER BY 
REMOVING THE 16 HOUR WEEKLY LIMIT ON THEIR VOLUNTARY WORK.  

IT IS WRONG TO IMAGINE THAT COMPASSION MUST BE NATIONALISED AND THAT WE CAN ONLY 
HELP OUR FELLOW MAN THROUGH STATE ACTION. 

4.  EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITY

ALL CHILDREN DREAM OF WHAT THEY MIGHT DO WHEN THEY GROW UP.  OUR TASK IS TO HELP 
THEM TURN THOSE DREAMS INTO REALITY WHATEVER THEIR BACKGROUND MAY BE.  IT IS AN 
EXCITING WORLD, FULL OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR INQUIRING MINDS:  IT SHOULD BE 
OPEN TO EVERY CHILD.  THEIR FUTURE - AND BRITAIN'S PROSPERITY - DEPENDS ON THE 
QUALITY OF THEIR EDUCATION.

OUR EDUCATION GUARANTEE
A GOOD EDUCATION IS THE BIRTHRIGHT OF EVERY CHILD.  LITERACY IS THE BUILDING 
BLOCK OF ALL FUTURE LEARNING: ENGLISH IS THE GLOBAL LANGUAGE OF COMMERCE AND, 
MUCH MORE, A THING OF BEAUTY.  WITHOUT BASIC SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS, THE MODERN 
WORLD IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE.  EVERY CHILD THEREFORE MUST BE TAUGHT TO READ, WRITE 
AND ADD UP FROM AN EARLY AGE.  

YEARS OF MISTAKEN, PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION IN THE 1960S AND 1970S DENIED THESE 
PRECIOUS SKILLS TO TOO MANY CHILDREN.  WE HAVE WORKED CEASELESSLY SINCE 1979 TO 
PUT THAT RIGHT.  OUR DECISION TO TEST CHILDREN AND PUBLISH THE RESULTS HAS 
ALLOWED STANDARDS TO BE MEASURED AND EXPOSED.  WE HAVE REFORMED THE CURRICULUM, 
TOUGHENED INSPECTIONS, AND GIVEN MORE INFORMATION AND POWER TO PARENTS.  OUR 
MANY EXCELLENT TEACHERS NOW KNOW WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM, AND ALREADY STANDARDS 
IN SCHOOLS ARE RISING.  BUT THEY ARE STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH.  WE MUST DO MORE.  

BUILDING ON WHAT WE HAVE DONE, WE CAN NOW OFFER A NEW PLEDGE TO PARENTS - A 
GUARANTEE OF EDUCATION STANDARDS. 

*	FIRST, WE WILL SET NATIONAL TARGETS FOR SCHOOL PERFORMANCE THAT REFLECT 
OUR OBJECTIVE OF ENSURING THAT BRITAIN IS IN THE TOP LEAGUE OF INTERNATIONAL 
STANDARDS ACROSS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF EDUCATION.

*	SECOND, WE WILL REQUIRE EVERY SCHOOL TO PLAN HOW TO IMPROVE ITS 
PERFORMANCE, AND TO SET TARGETS WHICH RELATE TO SIMILAR SCHOOLS AND NATIONAL 
STANDARDS.  

*	THIRD, WE WILL GIVE ALL PARENTS FULL INFORMATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF 
THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL.

*	FOURTH, TO UNDERWRITE OUR PLEDGE, WE WILL ENSURE ACTION IS TAKEN TO BRING 
ANY UNDER-PERFORMING SCHOOL UP TO THE MARK.

WE WILL MEET THIS PLEDGE BY USING THE FULL SET OF LEVERS FOR IMPROVED STANDARDS 
THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE.  

WE ARE REVISING AND SIMPLIFYING THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS TO 
EMPHASISE HIGH STANDARDS IN THE BASIC SKILLS.

PARENTS AND TEACHERS MUST HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF NOT JUST HOW MUCH A CHILD HAS 
LEARNT WHILE AT SCHOOL, BUT HOW THE SCHOOL PERFORMS AGAINST OTHERS.  POOR 
SCHOOLING MUST NOT BE PROTECTED BY A VEIL OF SECRECY.  PARENT POWER IS A VITAL 
FORCE FOR HIGHER STANDARDS.

REGULAR TESTS AND EXAMS ARE ESSENTIAL IF TEACHERS ARE TO DISCOVER HOW MUCH THEIR 
PUPILS HAVE LEARNT, AND PARENTS ARE TO KNOW HOW MUCH PROGRESS THEIR CHILDREN ARE 
MAKING AGAINST NATIONAL STANDARDS.  THAT IS WHY CHILDREN ARE ALREADY BEING 
TESTED AT 7, 11 AND 14.
*	WE WILL PUBLISH ALL SCHOOL TEST RESULTS, INCLUDING THE RESULTS OF TESTS OF 
7 AND 14 YEAR OLDS.

*	WE PROPOSE ALSO TO ASSESS EVERY CHILD AT FIVE.

THIS WILL GIVE TEACHERS AND PARENTS A BENCHMARK AGAINST WHICH THEY CAN MEASURE 
FUTURE PROGRESS.  TO GIVE A BETTER MEASURE OF PUPILS PERFORMANCE, MARKS OUT OF 
100 WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS AS WELL AS THE BROAD-BRUSH LEVELS.

*	WE WILL ALSO INTRODUCE A NEW TEST FOR 14 YEAR OLD CHILDREN THAT COVERS THE 
WHOLE NATIONAL CURRICULUM - ASSESSING PROGRESS BEFORE THEY CHOOSE SUBJECTS FOR 
GCSE.

TESTS AND EXAMS NEED TO BE RIGOROUS AND DEMANDING.  WE WILL INSIST THAT THEY 
ESTABLISH CHILDREN'S COMMAND OF SPELLING, PUNCTUATION, AND GRAMMAR IN ENGLISH 
TESTS.  CHILDREN WILL SIT ARITHMETIC TESTS WITHOUT CALCULATORS.  WE WILL NOT 
ALLOW SUCH EXTENSIVE USE OF OPEN BOOKS IN TESTS AND IN GCSE EXAMS.  WE WILL 
ESTABLISH AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE GCSE.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO UPHOLD THE GOLD 
STANDARD OF A-LEVELS, AND ENSURE THAT THE GREAT CLASSICS OF OUR LITERATURE ARE 
STUDIED AT A-LEVEL.  AT THE SAME TIME STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO STUDY 
MORE SUBJECTS IN THE SIXTH FORM.

RIGOROUS TESTS SHOW HOW INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN AND SCHOOLS ARE PERFORMING AND 
EXPOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT GIVING CHILDREN THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE.  TO 
UNDERWRITE OUR GUARANTEE, WE WILL THEN TAKE ACTION TO IMPROVE STANDARDS.  WE 
CANNOT TOLERATE SCHOOLS THAT FAIL THEIR PUPILS.

BY THIS SUMMER EVERY SECONDARY SCHOOL IN THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE BEEN INSPECTED BY 
INDEPENDENT INSPECTORS, AND BY SUMMER 1998, EVERY PRIMARY SCHOOL WILL HAVE BEEN 
INSPECTED AS WELL.  WE HAVE THE POWER TO TAKE OVER FAILING SCHOOLS DIRECTLY AND 
CLOSE THEM IF NECESSARY.  WE WILL NOW GO FURTHER AND REQUIRE EVERY SCHOOL TO SET 
AND PUBLISH REGULAR TARGETS AND PLANS FOR IMPROVING THEIR ACADEMIC RESULTS.  
INDEPENDENT INSPECTORS WILL MONITOR THE RESULTS OF WEAKER SCHOOLS AND THEIR 
PLANS FOR IMPROVEMENT AT REGULAR INTERVALS.  

SOMETIMES, THOUGH, SCHOOLS ARE FAILING BECAUSE THE LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITY 
WHICH RUNS THEM IS FAILING.  THE AUTHORITIES WITH THE WORST GCSE RESULTS AND THE 
WORST RESULTS AT KEY STAGE 2 (11 YEAR OLDS) ARE RUN BY LABOUR.  THOSE CHILDREN 
NEED OUR HELP.

*	WE WILL ALLOW FOR AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTION OF EDUCATION AUTHORITIES AND 
INTERVENE DIRECTLY TO RAISE STANDARDS WHERE EDUCATION AUTHORITIES ARE LETTING 
CHILDREN DOWN.

FAILING AUTHORITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO SET OUT THEIR PLANS TO RAISE STANDARDS, 
AND WORK WITH EDUCATION TEAMS - DIRECTED BY INDEPENDENT INSPECTORS - TO 
IMPLEMENT THOSE PLANS.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF TEACHERS DO AN OUTSTANDING JOB.  THEY HAVE PLAYED A KEY 
PART IN IMPLEMENTING THE REFORMS THAT WE HAVE INTRODUCED.  A FEW THOUGH, FAIL 
THEIR PUPILS.  

*	WE WILL ESTABLISH A MORE RIGOROUS AND EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF APPRAISING 
TEACHERS, WHICH REFLECTS HOW WELL THEIR PUPILS PERFORM IN TESTS AND EXAMS: THIS 
WILL IDENTIFY WHICH TEACHERS NEED MORE HELP AND, WHERE NECESSARY, WHICH TEACHERS 
NEED TO BE REPLACED.

MANY FEEL THAT THE PROFESSIONAL STANDING OF TEACHERS WOULD BE STRENGTHENED BY 
THE CREATION OF A SINGLE BODY WHICH COULD SPEAK WITH AUTHORITY ON PROFESSIONAL 
STANDARDS.  WE WILL CONSULT WITH TEACHERS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ABOUT THE 
POSSIBLE ROLE OF SUCH A BODY.

THE SCHOOL SHOULD BE A PLACE OF STABILITY AND STIMULATION FOR CHILDREN, 
ESPECIALLY IF THEY COME FROM A HOSTILE OR TURBULENT ENVIRONMENT.  TO IMPROVE 
STANDARDS IN FUTURE OUR NEW TEACHER TRAINING CURRICULUM WILL STRESS TRADITIONAL 
TEACHING METHODS - INCLUDING WHOLE CLASS TEACHING AND LEARNING TO READ BY THE 
SOUNDS OF LETTERS.  WE WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE MORE TEACHERS TO ENTER THE PROFESSION 
THROUGH PRACTICAL TRAINING SCHEMES FOCUSED ON CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE SUCH AS THE 
GRADUATE TEACHER SCHEME.  A CHILD IS LIKELY TO LEARN MORE IN A WELL-ORDERED 
SCHOOL.  TEACHERS MUST HAVE THE POWERS THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE.  WE 
WILL GIVE TEACHERS GREATER POWER TO SET DETENTIONS TO EXCLUDE DISRUPTIVE PUPILS 
AND TO USE REASONABLE PHYSICAL RESTRAINT WHERE NECESSARY.   

SCHOOLS ALSO HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN SPIRITUAL AND MORAL EDUCATION.  
WE WILL TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL FULFILS ITS ROLE OF PROVIDING 
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION AND COLLECTIVE WORSHIP.

CHOICE AND DIVERSITY
WHEN WE CAME TO POWER IN 1979 THE SCHOOLS SYSTEM WAS TOTALLY DOMINATED BY ONE 
TYPE OF SCHOOL - THE MONOLITHIC COMPREHENSIVE.  THE SYSTEM FAILED OUR CHILDREN.  
IT TREATED EVERY CHILD THE SAME.  IT TOLD PARENTS WHERE TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN.  
IT DID NOT GIVE SCHOOLS THE FREEDOM TO RUN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS.

SINCE 1979 WE HAVE CREATED A RICH DIVERSITY OF SCHOOLS, TO SERVE THE VARIED 
TALENTS OF ALL CHILDREN AND GIVE PARENTS CHOICE WITHIN THAT DIVERSITY, BECAUSE 
WE BELIEVE THAT PARENTS KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

THAT IS WHY WE - AND ONLY WE - ARE COMMITTED TO GIVING THE PARENT OF EVERY FOUR 
YEAR OLD CHILD A VOUCHER FOR NURSERY EDUCATION SO THEY CAN CHOOSE THE PRE-SCHOOL 
EDUCATION THEY WANT FOR THEIR CHILD, WHETHER IN A PLAY-GROUP, A RECEPTION CLASS, 
OR A NURSERY SCHOOL IN THE PRIVATE OR STATE SECTOR.  

WE WILL GIVE MORE TALENTED CHILDREN, FROM LESS WELL-OFF BACKGROUNDS, THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO FEE-PAYING SCHOOLS BY EXPANDING THE ASSISTED PLACES SCHEME 
TO COVER ALL AGES OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION, IN LINE WITH OUR CURRENT SPENDING 
PLANS.  WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP IT FURTHER INTO A WIDER SCHOLARSHIP SCHEME 
COVERING ADDITIONAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.  THE FREEDOMS AND STATUS OF FEE-
PAYING SCHOOLS WILL BE PROTECTED.

GRANT-MAINTAINED SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN POPULAR WITH PARENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY - 
WHATEVER THEIR POLITICS.  WE WILL ENCOURAGE MORE SCHOOLS TO BECOME GRANT- 
MAINTAINED AND WILL ALLOW NEW GRANT-MAINTAINED SCHOOLS TO BE SET UP WHERE THERE 
IS SUFFICIENT LOCAL DEMAND.  WE WILL GIVE ALL GRANT-MAINTAINED SCHOOLS GREATER 
FREEDOMS TO EXPAND AND TO SELECT THEIR PUPILS.
  
GRANT-MAINTAINED SCHOOLS ARE LEADING THE WAY.  LOCAL AUTHORITY SCHOOLS ARE ALSO 
BENEFITTING FROM OUR POLICY OF LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF SCHOOLS.  OUR ULTIMATE 
OBJECTIVE IS THAT ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MANAGEMENT 
OF THEIR OWN AFFAIRS.  IN THE NEXT PARLIAMENT WE WILL TAKE ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS 
GIVING THEM THAT FREEDOM.

*	WE WILL EXTEND THE BENEFITS OF GREATER SELF-GOVERNANCE TO ALL LEA SCHOOLS.  
WE WILL REQUIRE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO DELEGATE MORE OF SCHOOLS' BUDGETS TO THE 
SCHOOLS THEMSELVES.  WE WILL GIVE THEM MORE FREEDOM OVER THE EMPLOYMENT OF THEIR 
STAFF AND OVER ADMISSIONS.  AND, WHERE THEY WANT IT, WE WILL ALLOW THEM TO TAKE 
OVER OWNERSHIP OF THEIR ASSETS, SO THEY CAN MAKE BEST USE OF THE RESOURCES.

LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR SCHOOLS' STANDARDS. 
THEY WILL PROVIDE FUNDS, AND COMPETE WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS TO PROVIDE 
SERVICES TO SCHOOLS. WE WOULD EXPECT THE INCREASED RESPONSIBILITY OF HEAD-
TEACHERS, AND THEIR ROLE IN ACHIEVING EFFICIENCY-SAVINGS, TO BE RECOGNISED BY 
THEIR PAY REVIEW BODY.

SCHOOLS ARE STRONGER AND MORE EFFECTIVE WHERE HEAD-TEACHERS AND GOVERNORS CAN 
SHAPE THEIR OWN DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER.  SOMETIMES THAT MEANS DEVELOPING A 
SPECIALITY IN SOME SUBJECTS.  SOMETIMES IT MEANS SELECTING CHILDREN BY THEIR 
APTITUDES: WHERE PARENTS WANT THIS WE SHOULD NOT STAND IN THEIR WAY.  SPECIAL 
ABILITIES SHOULD BE RECOGNISED AND ENCOURAGED.

*		WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MORE SPECIALIST 
SCHOOLS IN TECHNOLOGY, ARTS, LANGUAGES AND SPORT.  WE AIM TO HELP ONE IN FIVE 
SCHOOLS BECOME SPECIALIST SCHOOLS BY 2001.

*	WE WILL ALLOW ALL SCHOOLS TO SELECT SOME OF THEIR PUPILS.

*	WE WILL HELP SCHOOLS TO BECOME GRAMMAR SCHOOLS IN EVERY MAJOR TOWN WHERE 
PARENTS WANT THAT CHOICE.

THE HIGH STANDARDS, REAL CHOICE AND GENUINE DIVERSITY WHICH WE HAVE INTRODUCED 
WILL PRODUCE THE BEST RESULTS FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN.

LIFETIME LEARNING
LIFETIME LEARNING IS A REALITY IN BRITAIN TODAY.  OVER A HALF OF ALL STUDENTS IN 
UNIVERSITIES, AND SEVENTY PER CENT OF THOSE IN FURTHER EDUCATION COLLEGES, ARE 
ADULTS WHO HAVE RETURNED TO EDUCATION LATER IN LIFE.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE 
NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE.

THERE HAS BEEN A REVOLUTION IN FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION.  THREE AND A HALF 
MILLION PEOPLE ARE IN FURTHER EDUCATION - UP FROM JUST HALF A MILLION IN 1979.  
THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE GOING TO UNIVERSITY HAS RISEN FROM ONE IN EIGHT TO 
ONE IN THREE OVER THE SAME PERIOD.

WE WILL ENSURE CONSISTENTLY HIGH STANDARDS AND WILL CONSULT ON THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF HIGHER EDUCATION WHEN WE RECEIVE THE RESULTS OF THE DEARING REVIEW.  WE HAVE 
WORLD CLASS RESEARCH IN BRITISH UNIVERSITIES WHICH WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT.

EVERY YOUNG PERSON SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE IN EDUCATION OR 
TRAINING.

*	WE WILL GIVE STUDENTS BETWEEN 14 AND 21 A LEARNING CREDIT WHICH WILL 
ENABLE THEM TO CHOOSE SUITABLE EDUCATION OR TRAINING LEADING TO RECOGNISED 
QUALIFICATIONS UP TO A LEVELS OR THEIR EQUIVALENTS.

WE WILL ALSO INTRODUCE NATIONAL TRAINEESHIPS AND ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO OFFER 
MORE WORK-BASED MODERN APPRENTICESHIPS TO YOUNG PEOPLE.  OBJECTIVE EXTERNAL 
ASSESSMENTS OF A PROPER SYLLABUS WILL BE MADE A PART OF ALL NATIONAL VOCATIONAL 
QUALIFICATIONS.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE NETWORK OF TRAINING AND ENTERPRISE COUNCILS, 
WHICH HAVE CREATED A VALUABLE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT.  WE 
WILL ENCOURAGE MORE EMPLOYERS TO BECOME INVOLVED IN "INVESTORS IN PEOPLE", WITH 
THE PUBLIC SECTOR MATCHING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

COMPETITIVE MARKETS DEMAND HIGH SKILLS.  IF BRITAIN IS TO WIN, WE NEED TO 
ENCOURAGE LEARNING AND GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO WHERE THEIR INTERESTS 
AND INQUIRING MINDS TAKE THEM.


	WORLD CLASS HEALTH AND PUBLIC SERVICES


OUR RECORD - HEALTH AND PUBLIC SERVICES

*	GOVERNMENT SPENDING HAS CONCENTRATED ON PRIORITIES, NOT WASTEFUL 
BUREAUCRACY AND OVERMANNING.  DESPITE TOUGH OVERALL SPENDING PLANS, REAL 
SPENDING ON THE NHS HAS RISEN NEARLY 75% SINCE 1979, ON SCHOOLS BY 50% AND ON 
THE POLICE BY MORE THAN 100%.

* 	THE HEALTH SERVICE IS TREATING OVER L MILLION MORE PATIENTS EACH YEAR THAN 
BEFORE OUR REFORMS.

* 	THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WAITING OVER 12 MONTHS FOR HOSPITAL TREATMENT HAS 
FALLEN FROM OVER 200,000 IN 1990 TO 22,000 LAST YEAR. THE AVERAGE WAIT HAS 
FALLEN FROM NEARLY 9 MONTHS  TO 4 MONTHS. 

*	THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET UP THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER TO PROVIDE FIRST CLASS 
PUBLIC SERVICES FOR ALL CITIZENS. NEARLY 650 ORGANISATIONS HAVE RECEIVED A 
CHARTER MARK FOR MEETING DEMANDING STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE, CUSTOMER 
SATISFACTION AND VALUE FOR MONEY.

* 	THERE ARE NOW 55,000 MORE NURSES AND MIDWIVES AND 22,500 MORE DOCTORS AND 
DENTISTS THAN IN 1979.  FOR EVERY SENIOR NHS MANAGER, 77 PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING 
DIRECT PATIENT CARE.

*	NURSES AVERAGE EARNINGS HAVE GROWN 70% IN REAL TERMS:  FROM (POUND)68 A 
WEEK IN 1979 TO (POUND)325 IN 1995.  DOCTOR'S PAY HAS RISEN BY A THIRD.  UNDER 
LABOUR BOTH WERE CUT.

* 	INFANT MORTALITY HAS FALLEN FROM 13.2 TO 6.2 PER THOUSAND OVER THE LAST 18 
YEARS.

* 	DEATHS THROUGH ROAD ACCIDENTS ARE NOW THE LOWEST SINCE RECORDS BEGAN IN 
1926.  SINCE 1979 ROAD DEATHS HAVE FALLEN BY 43% AND SERIOUS CASUALTIES HAVE 
FALLEN BY 43% DESPITE AN 85% INCREASE IN MOTOR TRAFFIC.

* 	THE GOVERNMENT HAS INVESTED RECORD AMOUNTS ON TRANSPORT - MORE THAN 
(POUND)26 BILLION SINCE 1979 IN INVESTMENT ON MOTORWAYS AND TRUNK ROADS;  
(POUND)16 BILLION ON RAILWAYS;  AND OVER (POUND)8 BILLION ON LONDON TRANSPORT.

*	PRIVATISATION IS DELIVERING BETTER SERVICES AT LOWER COSTS.  BT'S MAIN 
PRICES ARE DOWN BY MORE THAN 40% IN REAL TERMS.  AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD BILLS FOR   
GAS AND ELECTRICITY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN REAL TERMS SINCE 1990.


5.	SECURITY IN HEALTH

WE HAVE BEEN THE GUARDIANS OF THE NHS FOR MOST OF ITS LIFE, IMPROVING ITS 
SERVICES AND SECURING ITS FUNDING.  THE BENEFITS CAN BE SEEN IN OUR RISING 
STANDARDS OF HEALTH.  1993 WAS FOR EXAMPLE THE FIRST YEAR IN WHICH NO CHILD IN 
THIS COUNTRY DIED OF MEASLES.  BETWEEN 1979 AND 1995 LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH IN 
ENGLAND HAS INCREASED FROM 70.4 YEARS TO 74.3 YEARS FOR MEN AND FROM 76.4 YEARS 
TO 79.6 YEARS FOR WOMEN.  WE ARE GETTING HEALTHIER AND WE ARE BETTER LOOKED 
AFTER WHEN WE ARE SICK.  

GROWING RESOURCES FOR A MODERN HEALTH SERVICE
THIS PROGRESS HAS BEEN POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAVE INCREASED SPENDING SINCE 1979 BY 
70% MORE THAN INFLATION, TO NEARLY (POUND)43 BILLION.  AND WE ARE NOT STOPPING 
THERE.  THE NEXT CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL HONOUR A UNIQUE GUARANTEE TO THE 
NHS.

*	WE WILL CONTINUE, YEAR BY YEAR, TO INCREASE THE REAL RESOURCES COMMITTED 
TO THE NHS, SO NHS SPENDING WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE IN A GROWING ECONOMY.

UNDER LABOUR THERE HAVE BEEN YEARS WHEN RESOURCES FOR THE NHS ACTUALLY SHRANK - 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE INCONCEIVABLE WITH THE CONSERVATIVES.  

MONEY IS ONLY REALLY A MEANS TO AN END:  BETTER PATIENT CARE.  NOW WE ARE 
TREATING 9.2 MILLION HOSPITAL IN-PATIENTS AND DAY CASES AS AGAINST 6.9 MILLION 
IN 1992 AND 5.1 MILLION IN 1979.  

INVESTING IN SKILLED STAFF
WE ARE COMMITTED TO EXPANDING THE MEDICAL STAFF OF THE NHS.  WE SHALL THEREFORE 
INCREASE MEDICAL SCHOOL INTAKES TO 5,000 A YEAR BY THE YEAR 2000 AND ARE AHEAD 
OF SCHEDULE IN REACHING THE TARGET.  

GOOD NURSING IS THE BEDROCK OF THE NHS.  IN PARTICULAR WE WILL INCREASE THE 
NUMBER OF NURSES WITH SPECIALIST QUALIFICATIONS IN PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE, 
EMERGENCY CARE, AND CANCER CARE.  THE NUMBER OF NURSES QUALIFYING EACH YEAR WILL 
INCREASE IN EACH OF THE NEXT 5 YEARS AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND PROJECT 2000 
TRAINING.

HIGHER STANDARDS OF SERVICE
WE ARE TACKLING THE PROBLEM OF LONG WAITING TIMES WHICH CAN CAUSE SO MUCH WORRY, 
DISTRESS, AND PAIN.  WE HAVE SET TOUGH TARGETS UNDER THE PATIENTS CHARTER AND AS 
A RESULT AVERAGE WAITING TIMES FOR INPATIENT HOSPITAL TREATMENTS HAVE FALLEN 
FROM MORE THAN 6 MONTHS 5 YEARS AGO TO 4 MONTHS LAST YEAR.

PATIENTS NO LONGER PUT UP WITH BEING KEPT IN IGNORANCE.  THEY WANT TO KNOW MORE.  

*	WE WILL PUBLISH MORE INFORMATION ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY HOSPITALS ARE 
TREATING PATIENTS SO THAT THEY AND THEIR GPS CAN MAKE MORE INFORMED CHOICES 
BETWEEN SERVICES IN DIFFERENT HOSPITALS AND HELP STIMULATE BETTER PERFORMANCE.

BETTER PRIMARY CARE
OUR VISION OF THE NHS IS ONE IN WHICH HOSPITALS AND FAMILY DOCTORS GAIN GREATER 
POWER TO RUN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS.  THAT IS WHY WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE 
SPREAD OF FUNDHOLDING AMONG GPS.  LABOUR BY CONTRAST WOULD DESTROY THE NEW 
FREEDOMS THAT FUNDHOLDING DOCTORS ENJOY BY IMPOSING A NEW LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY 
ON TOP OF THEM.  

HOWEVER, WE DO NOT WANT THE BENEFITS OF BETTER HEALTHCARE TO BE CONFINED TO 
PATIENTS OF GP FUNDHOLDERS.  OUR PROPOSALS TO SHIFT MORE HEALTHCARE TOWARDS 
FAMILY DOCTORS ARE OPEN TO ALL.

*	WE SHALL IMPLEMENT THE NEW PRIMARY CARE ACT WHICH WILL ENABLE ALL FAMILY 
DOCTORS TO PROVIDE A BROADER RANGE OF PATIENT SERVICES WITHIN THEIR SURGERIES.  
THIS WILL INCLUDE "SUPER SURGERIES" AND PRACTICE-BASED COTTAGE HOSPITALS THAT 
CAN OFFER FASTER AND MORE LOCAL TREATMENT.

WE EXPECT TO SEE THE NUMBER OF NURSES WORKING IN GP PRACTICES CONTINUE TO GROW, 
AS WILL THE NUMBER OF GPS. 

*	WE WILL EXTEND NATIONWIDE OUR PLANS TO ENABLE MORE NURSES TO PRESCRIBE A 
WIDER RANGE OF DRUGS FOR PATIENTS, RECOGNISING THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO PRIMARY 
CARE.

MENTAL HEALTH
THE LAST DECADE HAS ALSO SEEN MAJOR CHANGES TO THE CARE OF MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE.  
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES - INCLUDING 24-HOUR NURSED 
HOSTELS AND SECURE UNITS - THAT CAN CARE FOR THEM IN A WAY WHICH IS MOST 
APPROPRIATE TO THEM AND THE INTERESTS OF THE WIDER COMMUNITY.  

*	WE WILL NOT CLOSE ANY LONG-STAY MENTAL HOSPITALS UNLESS IT CAN BE SHOWN 
THAT ADEQUATE CARE SERVICES EXIST IN THE COMMUNITY.  

WE WILL STRENGTHEN CO-OPERATION BETWEEN HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES IN THE 
DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.  OUR RECENT GREEN PAPER SHOWED HOW THIS CAN 
BE DONE.  AND WE WILL MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF HEALTH AUTHORITIES IN DEVELOPING 
PROPER MENTAL HEALTH CARE PLANS.

HEALTH OF THE NATION
A MODERN HEALTH SERVICE IS NOT JUST ABOUT TREATING ILLNESS, IT IS ALSO ABOUT 
KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY.  THIS IS WHY WE LAUNCHED THE HEALTH OF THE NATION 
STRATEGY IN 1992 - THE FIRST TIME ENGLAND HAS HAD A STRATEGY FOR HEALTH.  ITS 
AIM IS TO REDUCE ILLNESS AND PREMATURE DEATH BY IDENTIFYING COMMON CAUSES OF ILL 
HEALTH, LIKE EXCESSIVE SMOKING AND OBESITY.  DIFFERENT GROUPS IN AND OUTSIDE THE 
HEALTH SERVICE THEN WORK TOGETHER TO TACKLE THE PROBLEMS.

WE ARE ALREADY SEEING PROGRESS.  BETWEEN 1990 AND 1994, DEATHS FROM CORONARY 
HEART DISEASE AMONG THE OVER- 65S, THE SUICIDE RATE, AND THE NUMBER OF TEENAGE 
PREGNANCIES FELL SUBSTANTIALLY.  AND LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL 
TARGETS WOULD BE ADDED TO HEALTH OF THE NATION.

IMPROVED GENERAL HEALTH MEANS FEWER PEOPLE REQUIRING ATTENTION IN HOSPITALS AND 
GP SURGERIES - AND MORE RESOURCES TO BE SPENT ON HELPING PATIENTS.  OUR HEALTH 
OF THE NATION STRATEGY IS A VITAL PART OF OUR VISION OF CREATING A HEALTH 
SERVICE FIT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.

A MODERN HEALTH SERVICE
HEALTHCARE IS CHANGING FAST.  MODERN TECHNOLOGY IS CONSTANTLY INCREASING THE 
RANGE OF TREATMENTS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE.  CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE THAT THE 
BENEFITS OF THESE ADVANCES SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS ON THE BASIS OF 
THEIR CLINICAL NEED, WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY.

FURTHERMORE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE NHS MUST HAVE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT 
RESOURCES TO ALLOW IT TO INVEST IN THE FACILITIES REQUIRED TO DELIVER UP- TO- 
DATE HEALTHCARE.  SINCE 1979 CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE NHS HAS PROCEEDED AT AN 
UNPRECEDENTED RATE.  IN THE FUTURE WE BELIEVE THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE BEST 
MET IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH ALLOWS THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO 
IMPROVE THE FACILITIES IN WHICH NHS HEALTHCARE IS DELIVERED.

*	WE WILL PROMOTE THE PRIVATE FINANCE INITIATIVE WHICH WILL UNLEASH A NEW 
FLOW OF INVESTMENT FUNDS INTO THE MODERNISATION OF THE NHS.

THE NHS IS A BRITISH SUCCESS STORY.  IT COMMANDS UNIVERSAL SUPPORT IN BRITAIN.  
IT IS WIDELY ADMIRED ALL OVER THE WORLD.  CONSERVATIVES ARE PROUD OF THE PART WE  
PLAYING IN IMPROVING IT STILL FURTHER.


6.	BETTER PUBLIC SERVICES

THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS BEING TRANSFORMED THE WORLD OVER.  BRITAIN IS IN THE 
VANGUARD.  EVERYONE ELSE WANTS TO LEARN FROM OUR VISION OF A SMALLER STATE DOING 
FEWER THINGS AND DOING THEM BETTER.

OLD STYLE PUBLIC SERVICES WERE CENTRALLY PLANNED WITH LITTLE INFORMATION OR 
CHOICE FOR THE PUBLIC WHO USED THE SERVICE.  OUR REFORMS HAVE MADE THESE 
SERVICES MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE PUBLIC BY BREAKING UP CUMBERSOME BUREAUCRATIC 
STRUCTURES AND SHIFTING POWER TO SMALL RESPONSIVE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE 
PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THEM.  THE SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS AND POLICE HAVE ALL BEEN 
TRANSFORMED IN THIS WAY.  WE SUPPORT THE PEOPLE WHO DO, NOT THE PEOPLE WHO PLAN.

IN ORDER TO GET BETTER STANDARDS WE ARE LIBERATING SERVICES FROM CENTRALISED 
CONTROL OVER CAPITAL.  WE WILL PUSH FORWARD OUR PRIVATE FINANCE INITIATIVE TO 
BREAK DOWN THESE OLD BARRIERS.

WE HAVE MADE PUBLIC SERVICES GENUINELY ACCOUNTABLE, WITH USEFUL INFORMATION AND 
REAL CHOICES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO USE THEM.  WE SET TOUGH STANDARDS AND THEY WILL 
GET TOUGHER.  THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER HAS RAISED STANDARDS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  
WHEN THESE HIGH STANDARDS ARE REACHED WE RECOGNISE AND REWARD EXCELLENCE THROUGH 
OUR CHARTER MARK INITIATIVE.  THERE ARE NOW 647 CHARTERMARKS AND WE WILL AIM FOR 
MORE THAN 2000 CHARTERMARKS BY THE YEAR 2000.

*	WE WILL REQUIRE ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO APPLY FOR CHARTERMARKS. 

THE DAYS OF THE BUREAUCRATIC PAPERCHASE ARE BEHIND US.  THE FUTURE IS 
"GOVERNMENT DIRECT".  WE WILL HARNESS THE LATEST INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO PLACE 
THE PUBLIC SECTOR DIRECTLY AT THE SERVICE OF THE CITIZEN.  PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE 
TO USE SIMPLE COMPUTER TERMINALS TO ENTER INFORMATION DIRECTLY.  THIS WILL 
TRANSFORM TIME-CONSUMING TRANSACTIONS LIKE COMPLETING A TAX RETURN OR 
REGISTERING A NEW BUSINESS.

PRIVATISATION AND COMPETITION
IN 20 YEARS, PRIVATISATION HAS GONE FROM THE DREAM OF A FEW CONSERVATIVE 
VISIONARIES TO THE BIG IDEA WHICH IS TRANSFORMING DECAYING PUBLIC SECTOR 
INDUSTRIES IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.  BRITAIN HAS LED THE WAY WITH 
THIS NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION:  WE CAN BE PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED.  

IN 1979 THE GOVERNMENT INHERITED A RANGE OF BUSINESSES WHICH HAD COME INTO THE 
PUBLIC SECTOR FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.  MANY WERE KNOWN FOR THEIR POOR STANDARDS 
OF SERVICE, AND MOST WERE MAKING LARGE LOSSES.

OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT SITUATION HAS CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY.  
PRIVATISATION HAS ENHANCED PRODUCTIVITY, IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICES, RAISED 
SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED PRICES.

TELEPHONE, GAS AND ELECTRICITY BILLS TO THE CUSTOMER HAVE FALLEN AS NEVER 
BEFORE. TELEPHONE WAITING LISTS ARE UNKNOWN, AND WATER, GAS AND ELECTRICITY 
DISCONNECTIONS HAVE FALLEN DRAMATICALLY.  NEARLY (POUND)40 BILLION IN PRIVATE 
SECTOR FUNDING HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO A MAJOR INVESTMENT PROGRAMME TO MEET HIGHER 
QUALITY WATER STANDARDS.  WE CAN NOW LOOK FORWARD TO WATER PRICES FALLING OVER 
THE YEARS AHEAD.

SERVICE STANDARDS HAVE IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY.  BEFORE PRIVATISATION PUBLISHED 
SERVICE STANDARDS DID NOT EXIST.  NOW INDUSTRY REGULATORS MONITOR LEGAL 
REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICES IN A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.  REFUNDS 
MAY BE MADE WHEN PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ARE NOT MET.

PRIVATISATION HAS BENEFITTED - AND WILL CONTINUE TO BENEFIT - CONSUMERS, 
SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AND TAXPAYERS.  IN 1979 THE THEN-NATIONALISED 
INDUSTRIES REQUIRED A (POUND)50 MILLION PER WEEK SUBSIDY FROM THE TAXPAYER.  IN 
1996 THOSE NOW PRIVATISED COMPANIES PAID TAXES OF (POUND)60 MILLION PER WEEK.

*	WE WILL ENSURE PRIVATE OWNERSHIP, COMPETITION AND REGULATION CONTINUE TO 
DELIVER LOWER PRICES AND BETTER SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS.  

*	WE WILL EXTEND COMPETITION FOR DOMESTIC GAS USERS, AND INTRODUCE 
COMPETITION IN THE WATER INDUSTRY, STARTING WITH LARGE USERS.

THE POST OFFICE OCCUPIES AN IMPORTANT PART IN NATIONAL LIFE.  IT COMPRISES 
COUNTER SERVICES, THE ROYAL MAIL AND PARCELFORCE.  THE NETWORK OF SUB-POST 
OFFICES IS VITAL AND MOST ARE ALREADY RUN AS PRIVATE BUSINESSES.  THE ROYAL MAIL 
PROVIDES A UNIVERSAL SERVICE AT A STANDARD PRICE IN EVERY PART OF THE UNITED 
KINGDOM.  NO ONE CAN IMAGINE A STAMP THAT DOES NOT BEAR THE QUEEN'S HEAD.  THESE 
CHARACTERISTICS MUST CONTINUE, BUT REFORMS ARE NEEDED TO ALLOW THE SERVICES TO 
DEVELOP.  THE ROYAL MAIL MUST FACE UP TO THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT 
ARE ARISING FROM INCREASING COMPETITION AND THE INTERNATIONAL LIBERALISATION OF 
SERVICES.

*	WE WILL GUARANTEE TO PRESERVE THE NATIONAL IDENTITY, UNIVERSAL SERVICE AND 
DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ROYAL MAIL, WHILE CONSIDERING OPTIONS - 
INCLUDING DIFFERENT FORMS OF PRIVATISATION - TO INTRODUCE PRIVATE CAPITAL AND 
MANAGEMENT SKILLS INTO ITS OPERATIONS.

*	WE WILL TRANSFER PARCELFORCE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHILST ENSURING THAT 
EVERY POST OFFICE IN THE LAND CONTINUES TO PROVIDE A FULL PARCEL SERVICE AT AN 
ECONOMICAL PRICE.  

PRIVATISATION WORKS.  WE WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE TO PASS GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES 
INTO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP WHERE THIS CAN BRING BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT
WE ARE DEVELOPING A NEW VISION FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

WE BELIEVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE A LEAD IN THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT 
OF THEIR COMMUNITIES.  TO ACHIEVE THAT, WE HAVE ENCOURAGED THEM TO WORK IN 
PARTNERSHIP WITH CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, WITH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, AND OTHER 
ORGANISATIONS IN THEIR COMMUNITY.  THE IMPACT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS MULTIPLIED 
WHEN THEY WORK IN THIS WAY.

TO ENCOURAGE THIS PARTNERSHIP, WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE NEW APPROACH OF CHALLENGE 
FUNDING.  WE SET UP A FUND TO MEET A PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE AND THEN INVITE 
COMPETING BIDS FOR THE MONEY.  THOSE WHO FORM EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIPS ARE FAR 
MORE LIKELY TO WIN THOSE BIDS.  THE SINGLE REGENERATION BUDGET FUND, FOR 
EXAMPLE, HAS STIMULATED MANY WORKING PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE BRINGING NEW LIFE TO 
THEIR COMMUNITIES.

THIS INNOVATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM THE FINANCING OF THE PUBLIC 
SECTOR.

*	WE WILL PUSH CHALLENGE FUNDING FURTHER TO REWARD EFFECTIVE LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT.  

IN ADDITION, WE ARE ENCOURAGING HIGHER STANDARDS AND MORE COST-EFFECTIVE 
PROVISION OF LOCAL SERVICES.  LOCAL AUTHORITIES CAN ENABLE THINGS TO HAPPEN 
RATHER THAN NECESSARILY RUNNING THEMSELVES.  THEY MUST LOOK AFTER THE INTERESTS 
OF USERS OF THEIR SERVICES - AND THAT IS OFTEN BEST DONE BY BEING A PURCHASER, 
NOT AN EMPLOYER.

STANDARDS OF SERVICE ARE RISING IN MANY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, 
STILL GREAT DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE BEST AND WORST PERFORMERS, AS THE AUDIT 
COMMISSION SHOWS IN THEIR THOUGHT-PROVOKING REPORTS.

*	WE WILL KEEP UP THE PRESSURE FOR HIGHER STANDARDS AND IMPROVED VALUE FOR 
MONEY BY INSISTING ON COMPULSORY COMPETITIVE TENDERING.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHALLENGE FUNDING AND THE SHIFT IN THE ROLE OF LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES FROM DIRECT EMPLOYERS TO PURCHASERS OF SERVICES WILL TRANSFORM LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES OVER THE COMING YEARS.  IN THE MEANTIME WE WILL, FOR SO LONG AS IS 
NECESSARY, RETAIN THE POWER TO CAP LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PROTECT TAXPAYERS.

STRIKES IN ESSENTIAL SERVICES
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED.  INSOFAR AS THERE IS 
A STILL A PROBLEM IT IS CONCENTRATED IN A FEW ESSENTIAL SERVICES WHERE THE 
PUBLIC HAS NO EASY ALTERNATIVE AND STRIKERS ARE ABLE TO IMPOSE MASSIVE COSTS AND 
INCONVENIENCE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE ISSUES AT STAKE.  WE WILL PROTECT 
ORDINARY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FROM THIS ABUSE OF POWER.  

*	WE WILL LEGISLATE TO REMOVE LEGAL IMMUNITY FROM INDUSTRIAL ACTION WHICH 
HAS DISPROPORTIONATE OR EXCESSIVE EFFECT.  MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND EMPLOYERS 
WILL BE ABLE TO SEEK INJUNCTIONS TO PREVENT INDUSTRIAL ACTION IN THESE 
CIRCUMSTANCES.  ANY STRIKE ACTION WILL ALSO HAVE TO APPROVED BY A MAJORITY OF 
ALL MEMBERS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE AND BALLOTS WILL HAVE TO BE REPEATED AT REGULAR 
INTERVALS IF NEGOTIATIONS ARE EXTENDED.  

TRANSPORT
OUR RAILWAYS ARE ALREADY IMPROVING NOW THEY HAVE BEEN LIBERATED INTO THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR.  PASSENGER NUMBERS ARE UP:  MORE PEOPLE ARE USING THE RAILWAYS EVERY 
DAY.  INVESTMENT IS UP:  RAILTRACK PLANS TO SPEND (POUND)4 MILLION EACH DAY ON 
IMPROVING STATIONS AND MAINTAINING AND RENEWING THE NETWORK.  THE NEW TRAIN 
OPERATORS ARE COMMITTED TO INVESTING (POUND)1.5 BILLION IN NEW AND REFURBISHED 
ROLLING STOCK.  AND KEY FARES ARE FALLING IN REAL TERMS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A 
GENERATION, WITH GUARANTEED PRICE CONTROLS KEEPING FARE INCREASES BELOW THE 
LEVEL OF INFLATION UNTIL AT LEAST 2003.  WE INTEND TO BUILD ON THIS GROWING 
SUCCESS STORY TO CREATE A THRIVING RAILWAY NETWORK FOR THE NEW CENTURY.

*	WE WILL COMPLETE THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF BRITISH RAIL INTO THE 
COMMERCIAL SECTOR.

WE NOW WANT TO DRAW IN PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO MODERNISE LONDON UNDERGROUND AND 
IMPROVE SERVICES TO PASSENGERS.

*	WE WILL BRING FORWARD PLANS TO PRIVATISE LONDON UNDERGROUND.  PROCEEDS 
FROM PRIVATISATION WILL BE RECYCLED IN ORDER TO MODERNISE THE NETWORK WITHIN 5 
YEARS - CREATING AN UNDERGROUND SYSTEM TO SERVE THE CAPITAL IN THE 21ST CENTURY.  
WE WILL REGULATE FARES SO THEY RISE BY NO MORE THAN INFLATION FOR AT LEAST 4 
YEARS AFTER PRIVATISATION.  WE WILL ALSO PROTECT SERVICES - INCLUDING THE TRAVEL 
CARD AND CONCESSIONARY FARES.

AFTER COMPLETING THE MODERNISATION OF THE NETWORK, THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAINING 
SURPLUS FROM PRIVATISATION WILL BE CHANNELLED INTO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR 
TRANSPORT INVESTMENT IN LONDON AND ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC TRANSPORT.  IN PARTICULAR, WE WILL USE THE 
EXISTING FUNDING FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PROMOTE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAKE IT 
EASIER TO TRANSFER FROM RAIL TO BUS.  

WE RECOGNISE THE NEEDS OF ROAD USERS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR TO SUSTAIN OUR ROAD BUILDING AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMME.  ALREADY UNDER 
THE PRIVATE FINANCE INITIATIVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS CONTRIBUTING SOME (POUND)1 
BILLION TO INVESTMENT IN ROADS AND ACHIEVING SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS IN CONSTRUCTION 
COSTS.  WE WILL ALSO TACKLE ROAD CONGESTION BY INTRODUCING NEW REGIONAL TRAFFIC 
CONTROL CENTRES, BY EXTENDING THE USE OF VARIABLE SPEED LIMITS, AND BY ENSURING 
THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE THE NECESSARY POWERS TO ACT.  WE WILL PROMOTE A 
CLEANER ENVIRONMENT BY SUPPORTING A EUROPE-WIDE REDUCTION IN VEHICLE EMISSIONS, 
AND ENCOURAGING THE MANUFACTURE OF MORE FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON OUR RECORD OF IMPROVING SAFETY ON ROLL-ON ROLL-OFF 
FERRIES AND CARGO SHIPS THROUGH HIGHER STANDARDS OF SURVIVABILITY AND THE 
MEASURES IN THE MERCHANT SHIPPING ACT.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL BY AIR.  ALREADY OVER 
THE LAST 5 YEARS OPENING UP THE MARKET IN EUROPE HAS LED TO MORE SERVICES AND 
LOWER FARES.  WE WILL BUILD ON THAT SUCCESS IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNITED 
STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES.  WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF REGIONAL AIRPORTS OFFERING NEW DIRECT SERVICES TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IN 
THE SAME WAY THAT WE HAVE ALREADY OPENED UP NEW REGIONAL LINKS WITH EUROPE AND 
THE UNITED STATES.  WE WILL PRIVATISE THE NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEM BECAUSE IT 
WILL BE RUN BETTER IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

COMPETITION AND ENTERPRISE ARE THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE OUR TRANSPORT SYSTEM.











	

	A SAFE AND CIVIL SOCIETY

OUR RECORD - A SAFE AND CIVIL SOCIETY
* 	SPENDING ON THE POLICE HAS DOUBLED SINCE 1979 AFTER ALLOWING FOR 
INFLATION.  THERE ARE NOW ABOUT 16,000 MORE POLICE OFFICERS THAN WHEN WE TOOK 
OFFICE. 2,360 MORE CONSTABLES HAVE BEEN RECRUITED SINCE THE LAST ELECTION AND 
THE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING CHIEF OFFICERS THE RESOURCES TO RECRUIT 5,000 EXTRA 
POLICE CONSTABLES OVER THE NEXT 3 YEARS.

* 	RECORDED CRIME HAS DROPPED IN EACH OF THE LAST 4 YEARS. IT IS NOW OVER 10% 
DOWN ON 1992 LEVELS - MORE THAN HALF A MILLION FEWER OFFENCES - THE BIGGEST DROP 
SINCE RECORDS WERE FIRST KEPT.

* 	THERE ARE NOW 153,000 NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH SCHEMES IN ENGLAND AND WALES - 
38,000 MORE THAN IN 1992 -  COVERING 5.5 MILLION HOMES. WE HAVE HELPED FUND OVER 
4,000 CLOSED CIRCUIT TV SCHEMES OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS FOR ADDITIONAL SECURITY. 

*	OUR NATIONAL DNA DATABASE - THE FIRST IN THE WORLD - NOW HAS OVER 112,000 
SAMPLES ON IT. 3,300 MATCHES HAVE SO FAR BEEN MADE BETWEEN SUSPECTS AND CRIME 
STAINS. 

*	THE GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED THE MAXIMUM PENALTY FOR TAKING A GUN TO A 
CRIME AND FOR ATTEMPTED RAPE TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT. SINCE 1985 THE AVERAGE 
SENTENCE FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST THE PERSON  HAS RISEN BY A THIRD AND FOR SEXUAL 
OFFENCES BY NEARLY 40%.

*	THE NUMBER OF CARS STOLEN HAS FALLEN BY NEARLY 20% IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
- THAT IS ABOUT 100,000 FEWER CARS STOLEN.

* 	WE HAVE BUILT 22 NEW PRISONS SINCE 1980. SLOPPING OUT HAS ENDED. NO 
PRISONERS NOW SLEEP THREE TO A CELL DESIGNED FOR ONE. PRISON ESCAPES HAVE FALLEN 
BY 80% SINCE THE LAST ELECTION.

*  	MANDATORY DRUG TESTING HAS BEEN INTRODUCED THROUGHOUT THE PRISON SERVICE.  
HOME LEAVE HAS BEEN CUT BACK - DOWN BY HALF IN TWO YEARS.

* 	WE HAVE MADE WITNESS INTIMIDATION A CRIME. 500 PEOPLE WERE CHARGED WITH 
THAT OFFENCE IN 1995 ALONE.

*	WE HAVE STEPPED UP THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS AND ORGANISED CRIME, GIVING THE 
SECURITY SERVICE POWERS TO SUPPORT THE POLICE AND CUSTOMS AND EXCISE IN TRACKING 
DOWN THE SERIOUS CRIMINALS.


7.	LAW, ORDER AND SECURITY

PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO SLEEP SAFELY IN THEIR HOMES AND WALK SAFELY ON THE 
STREETS.  GOVERNMENTS HAVE A DUTY TO MAINTAIN THAT SECURITY.

OUR REFORMS ARE AIMED AT ENSURING THAT CRIME DOES NOT PAY.  AND THEY ARE WORKING 
- THE PESSIMISTS AND THE SCOFFERS ARE WRONG.  RECORDED CRIME HAS FALLEN EVERY 
YEAR FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS.  IT IS NOW 10% LOWER THAN IT WAS IN 1992.  THAT IS 
OVER HALF A MILLION FEWER CRIMES - THE BIGGEST DROP SINCE RECORDS WERE FIRST 
KEPT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 19TH CENTURY.

BUT CRIME IS STILL TOO HIGH.  WE MUST DO MORE.  OUR AIM IS TO KEEP CRIME FALLING 
OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT. THIS IS WHAT WE WILL DO.

SAFER COMMUNITIES
ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR AND PETTY CRIME DISRUPT COMMUNITIES AND SPREAD HUMAN 
MISERY.  THE POLICE ARE RIGHTLY NOW VIGOROUSLY TACKLING PROBLEMS SUCH AS 
GRAFFITI, VANDALISM AND DRUNKENNESS.  WHERE SUCH BEHAVIOUR GOES UNCHECKED MORE 
SERIOUS CRIMES WILL FOLLOW.

*	WE WILL SUPPORT CHIEF CONSTABLES WHO DEVELOP LOCAL SCHEMES TO CRACK DOWN 
ON PETTY CRIME AND IMPROVE PUBLIC ORDER.

CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION HAS PROVED ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING PUBLIC 
SAFETY.

*	WE WILL FULFILL THE PRIME MINISTER'S PLEDGE TO SUPPORT THE INSTALLATION OF 
10,000 CCTV CAMERAS IN TOWN CENTRES AND PUBLIC PLACES IN THE 3 YEARS TO 1999.   
WE WILL PROVIDE (POUND)75 MILLION OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT TO 
CONTINUE EXTENDING CCTV  TO TOWN CENTRES, VILLAGES AND HOUSING ESTATES UP AND 
DOWN THE COUNTRY THAT WANT TO BID FOR SUPPORT.  

WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO TAKE OTHER STEPS TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF OUR STREETS 
AND COMMUNITIES.  IN THIS PARLIAMENT WE HAVE GIVEN THE POLICE POWER TO SEIZE 
ALCOHOL FROM UNDER 18S CAUGHT DRINKING IN PUBLIC.  THE POLICE HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
THE POWER TO STOP AND SEARCH IN A SPECIFIED AREA FOR UP TO 48 HOURS IF THEY 
REASONABLY BELIEVE PEOPLE TO BE CARRYING KNIVES.  

IDENTITY CARDS CAN ALSO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO SAFER COMMUNITIES.

*	WE WILL INTRODUCE A VOLUNTARY IDENTITY CARD SCHEME BASED ON THE NEW 
PHOTOGRAPHIC DRIVING LICENCE.  IT WILL, FOR EXAMPLE, ENABLE RETAILERS TO 
IDENTIFY YOUNGSTERS TRYING TO BUY ALCOHOL AND CIGARETTES OR RENT CLASSIFIED 
VIDEOS WHEN THEY ARE UNDER AGE.  

TACKLING JUVENILE CRIME
A FIFTH OF ALL CRIME IS COMMITTED BY UNDER-18S.  WE ARE ENCOURAGING SCHOOLS TO 
REDUCE TRUANCY THROUGH THE PUBLICATION OF LEAGUE TABLES AND BY SUPPORTING LOCAL 
PROJECTS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM.  WE ARE DEVELOPING A NETWORK OF LOCAL TEAMS TO 
IDENTIFY CHILDREN WHO ARE AT RISK OF TURNING TO CRIME AND TO TAKE EARLY STEPS TO 
ADDRESS THE FACTORS WHICH PUT THEM AT RISK.

WE WILL ENCOURAGE THESE LOCAL CHILD CRIME TEAMS TO REFER CHILDREN FROM PRIMARY 
SCHOOL AGE UPWARDS WHO ARE AT RISK OF, OR ACTUALLY, OFFENDING TO PROGRAMMES TO 
TACKLE THEIR BEHAVIOUR AND FULLY INVOLVE THEIR PARENTS.

*	THE COURTS WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPOSE AN ORDER - A PARENTAL CONTROL ORDER - 
ON THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN WHOM THEY BELIEVED COULD KEEP CONTROL OF THEIR 
CHILDREN BUT WERE REFUSING TO DO SO.

COURTS WILL BE GIVEN THE POWER TO ATTACH CONDITIONS TO PARENTAL CONTROL ORDERS.  
CONDITIONS MIGHT INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN IN AT NIGHT,  
TAKING THEIR CHILDREN TO AND FROM SCHOOL, ATTENDING A DRUG REHABILITATION CLINIC 
OR GOING TO SESSIONS TO IMPROVE THEIR SKILLS AS PARENTS.  PARENTS WHO BREACHED 
THESE CONDITIONS - IN DEFIANCE OF THE COURT - WOULD FACE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE 
SANCTIONS.

APPEARING BEFORE A YOUTH COURT SHOULD BE A DAUNTING EXPERIENCE FOR THE JUVENILE 
CONCERNED.  ALL TOO OFTEN IT IS NOT.  AT THE MOMENT ABOUT A THIRD OF ALL 
JUVENILES APPEARING BEFORE THE YOUTH COURTS ARE DISCHARGED WITHOUT ANY 
PUNISHMENT AT ALL.  THIS SENDS ALL THE WRONG SIGNALS TO YOUNGSTERS - 
PARTICULARLY FIRST TIME OFFENDERS - WHO THEN FEEL THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH CRIME.

*	WE WILL GIVE THE COURTS THE POWER TO IMPOSE SPEEDY SANCTIONS ON 
YOUNGSTERS, INVOLVING WHEREVER POSSIBLE AN ELEMENT OF REPARATION TO THE VICTIM.  
THE PROBATION SERVICE - RATHER THAN SOCIAL SERVICES - WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ENFORCING COMMUNITY PUNISHMENTS FOR UNDER-16S.

PERSISTENT JUVENILE OFFENDERS NEED TO BE PROPERLY PUNISHED.  WE ARE PILOTING A 
TOUGH NEW REGIME, WITH A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON DISCIPLINE, AT A YOUNG OFFENDER 
INSTITUTION AND AT THE MILITARY PRISON IN COLCHESTER.  IN 1994 WE DOUBLED THE 
MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR 15-17 YEAR OLDS TO 2 YEARS DETENTION IN A YOUNG OFFENDERS 
INSTITUTION.  WE HAVE GIVEN THE COURTS THE FREEDOM TO ALLOW THE PUBLICATION OF 
THE NAMES OF CONVICTED JUVENILES.  WE WILL GIVE THE COURTS THE POWER TO DETAIN 
PERSISTENT 12-14 YEAR OLD OFFENDERS IN SECURE TRAINING CENTRES ONCE THE PLACES 
BECOME AVAILABLE.

WE HAVE GIVEN THE COURTS THE POWER TO IMPOSE ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED CURFEWS ON 
10 TO 15 YEAR OLD OFFENDERS.  WE WILL INTRODUCE PILOTS TO TEST THEIR 
EFFECTIVENESS.  IF SUCCESSFUL WE WILL CONSIDER EXTENDING THEM NATIONWIDE.

CATCHING, CONVICTING AND PUNISHING
WE BACK THE POLICE EVERY INCH OF THE WAY.  THERE ARE NOW ABOUT 16,000 MORE 
POLICE OFFICERS - AND OVER 18,000 MORE CIVILIANS HELPING THEM - THAN WHEN WE 
TOOK OFFICE.  WE ARE PROVIDING CHIEF CONSTABLES WITH THE RESOURCES TO RECRUIT 
5,000 EXTRA POLICE CONSTABLES IN THE THREE YEARS TO 1999.

WE SUPPORT POLICE INITIATIVES TO TARGET THE HARD CORE OF PERSISTENT CRIMINALS.  
INTELLIGENCE IS CRUCIAL FOR THIS.

*	WE WILL ESTABLISH A NATIONAL CRIME SQUAD TO PROVIDE AN IMPROVED NATIONALLY 
COORDINATED APPROACH TO ORGANISED CRIME.

ONCE CAUGHT, CRIMINALS MUST BE CONVICTED AND THEN PROPERLY PUNISHED.  THE PUBLIC 
NEED TO BE PROTECTED.  WE HAVE REFORMED THE RIGHT TO SILENCE, DESPITE OPPOSITION 
FROM LABOUR.  THE NUMBER OF SUSPECTS REFUSING TO ANSWER POLICE QUESTIONS HAS 
NEARLY HALVED AS A RESULT.  

WE HAVE PILOTED CURFEW ORDERS FOR ADULT OFFENDERS.  THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO KEEP 
CRIMINALS INDOORS - CURBING THEIR FREEDOM AS A PUNISHMENT - AND KEEPING THEM OUT 
OF TROUBLE IN THE MEANTIME.

*	WE WILL EXTEND ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED CURFEW ORDERS NATIONWIDE FOR THOSE 
AGED 16 AND OVER.

PERSISTENT OFFENDERS ACCOUNT FOR A HIGH PROPORTION OF ALL CRIME.  PRISON WORKS - 
NOT ONLY AS A DETERRENT, BUT IN KEEPING CRIMINALS OFF THE STREET.  THOSE SENT TO 
PRISON ARE LESS LIKELY TO RE-OFFEND ON RELEASE THAN THOSE GIVEN A COMMUNITY 
PUNISHMENT.  WE WILL PROVIDE ANOTHER 8,500 PRISON PLACES BY THE YEAR 2000.

WE WILL INTRODUCE MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR VIOLENT AND PERSISTENT CRIMINALS TO HELP 
PROTECT THE PUBLIC MORE EFFECTIVELY, REVERSING LABOUR'S WRECKING AMENDMENTS TO 
OUR TOUGH CRIME BILL.  

*	ANYONE CONVICTED OF A SECOND SERIOUS SEXUAL OR VIOLENT CRIME, LIKE RAPE OR 
ARMED ROBBERY, WILL GET AN AUTOMATIC LIFE SENTENCE.  

*	PERSISTENT HOUSE BURGLARS AND DEALERS IN HARD DRUGS WILL RECEIVE MANDATORY 
MINIMUM PRISON SENTENCES OF 3 AND 7 YEARS RESPECTIVELY.  

*	WE WILL RESTORE HONESTY IN SENTENCING BY ENSURING THAT CRIMINALS SERVE THE 
SENTENCE INTENDED WITHOUT AUTOMATIC EARLY RELEASE.

SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS
CONCERN FOR THE VICTIM MUST BE AT THE HEART OF OUR ENTIRE APPROACH TO THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE STRONG BACKING TO VICTIM 
SUPPORT.  

WE WILL GIVE COURTS IN ALL CASES THE DISCRETION TO ALLOW WITNESSES TO GIVE 
EVIDENCE ANONYMOUSLY IF THEY BELIEVE THEM TO BE AT RISK FROM REPRISAL.  

*	WE WILL ALSO TAKE ACTION TO ALLOW A JUDGE TO STOP A DEFENDANT FROM 
PERSONALLY QUESTIONING THE VICTIM IN RAPE CASES AND OTHER CASES WHERE THE VICTIM 
IS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE.

CONSERVATIVES ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE VICTIMS NOT THE CRIMINAL.

STRENGTHENING THE FIGHT AGAINST CITY CRIME
CRIME THAT TAKES PLACE THROUGH MANIPULATION OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS AND MARKETS IS  
AS SERIOUS AS CRIME ON THE STREET.  

THE CITY'S UNCHALLENGED POSITION AS EUROPE'S MOST DYNAMIC AND SUCCESSFUL 
FINANCIAL CENTRE OWES A GREAT DEAL TO ITS REPUTATION FOR HONESTY AND FAIR 
DEALING.  WE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THIS REPUTATION IS MAINTAINED.

*	WE WILL BRING FORWARD IN THE NEXT PARLIAMENT A PACKAGE OF MEASURES 
DESIGNED TO MODERNISE THE CURRENT SYSTEMS FOR DEALING WITH CITY FRAUD.

THIS WILL INCLUDE LEGISLATION TO ALLOW THE INLAND REVENUE TO PASS CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION TO THE POLICE, THE SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE AND THE FINANCIAL REGULATORS 
TO ASSIST IN THE INVESTIGATION OF CASES INVOLVING SERIOUS FINANCIAL FRAUD.  WE 
WILL ALSO REMOVE THE REMAINING LEGAL OBSTACLES TO THE CONTROLLED EXCHANGE OF 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE REGULATORS IN THIS KIND OF 
CASE.

FASTER JUSTICE
JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED.  IT IS WRONG THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE INNOCENT 
SHOULD FACE AN EXCESSIVE WAIT BEFORE THE START OF THEIR TRIAL.  THE GUILTY NEED 
TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR ACTIONS PROMPTLY.  AND VICTIMS SHOULD BE GIVEN 
THE CHANCE TO DRAW A LINE UNDER THEIR EXPERIENCE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  WE ARE 
DETERMINED TO SPEED UP JUSTICE WITHOUT DIMINISHING THE GENUINE RIGHTS OF EVERY 
CITIZEN TO A FAIR TRIAL.

LAST OCTOBER THE GOVERNMENT SET UP A REVIEW OF DELAYS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
SYSTEM.  IT MADE A SERIES OF DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS.  WE SEE MERIT IN THOSE 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WILL SEEK THE VIEWS OF INTERESTED PARTIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT 
TAKEN TOGETHER THEY COULD DRAMATICALLY SPEED UP THE PROSECUTION PROCESS, 
BRINGING THE GUILTY TO JUSTICE AND ACQUITTING THE INNOCENT MORE QUICKLY.  

ALL DEFENDANTS WOULD APPEAR IN COURT THE NEXT WORKING DAY AFTER THEY WERE 
CHARGED.  AT LEAST HALF OF THEM WOULD BE CONVICTED THE NEXT DAY COMPARED WITH 
JUST 3 PER CENT AT THE MOMENT.  AND THE TIME TAKEN TO BRING JUVENILES TO COURT 
WOULD BE CUT FROM 10 WEEKS TO A MATTER OF DAYS.

CIVIL JUSTICE
THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM OF THIS COUNTRY IS A VITAL PART OF ITS COMPETITIVE 
ECONOMY AND HAS A HIGH INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION.  THE COMMERCIAL COURTS ATTRACT 
SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, GENERATING SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN 
EARNINGS.  WE WILL SEEK TO MAINTAIN THE HIGH STANDING OF THESE COURTS.

WE HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED THE SERVICE THE CIVIL COURTS PROVIDE FOR THE AGGRIEVED 
CITIZEN.  THE SIMPLE PROCEDURE FOR SMALL CLAIMS HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO CLAIMS UP 
TO (POUND)3,000.  FOR LARGE CLAIMS THE COUNTY COURT NOW PROVIDES AN EFFICIENT 
LOCAL SERVICE WITH SPECIALISED COURTS IN MANY LOCATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY, 
LEAVING THE HIGH COURT TO DEAL WITH THE MORE COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT ISSUES.

WE WILL PUSH AHEAD WITH THE MAJOR REFORMS NOW UNDER WAY WHICH WILL GREATLY SPEED 
UP THE PROCESS AND IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF JUSTICE WITHOUT IMPOSING ADDITIONAL 
BURDENS ON THE TAXPAYER.

THE LEGAL PROFESSION
WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THE LEGAL PROFESSION OPERATES IS 
RESPONSIVE TO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR PEOPLE AND IS ONE IN WHICH UNJUSTIFIED 
RESTRICTIONS HAVE NO PLACE.  WE HAVE, FOR EXAMPLE, GIVEN MOST SOLICITORS RIGHTS 
OF AUDIENCE IN THE HIGHER COURTS UNDER APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS.

LEGAL AID
PEOPLE ARE RIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISING COSTS OF LEGAL AID.  WE HAVE TAKEN 
MANY STEPS TO CONTROL THE BURDEN AND TO DENY ACCESS TO LEGAL AID TO THE 
"APPARENTLY WEALTHY" - THOSE WHO QUALIFIED TECHNICALLY, BUT WHOSE LIFESTYLES 
SUGGESTED THEY SHOULD NOT.

BUT MORE IS REQUIRED:

*	WE WILL CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF LEGAL AID TO ENSURE THAT IT, LIKE OTHER 
VITAL PUBLIC SERVICES, FUNCTIONS WITHIN DEFINED CASH LIMITS.  

THIS WILL ENABLE US TO IDENTIFY PRIORITIES AND SERVE THEM MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY 
THAN THE PRESENT SYSTEM.

DRUGS
DRUGS ARE A MENACE TO THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY.  THEY RUIN THE LIFE OF 
ADDICTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.  THEY CAN DESTROY WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOODS.  THE 
PROMISING YOUTH OF TODAY CAN TOO EASILY BECOME THE SAD DROPOUTS OF TOMORROW, 
TURNING TO CRIME AND VIOLENCE.

THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT HAS A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY, LAUNCHED IN 1995, 
COMMITTED TO FIGHTING DRUGS IN COMMUNITIES AND IN SCHOOLS.  IT IS TOUGH ON 
CRIMINALS AND VIGILANT AT OUR PORTS.  IT IS RESPECTED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  WE 
SPEND OVER (POUND)500M EVERY YEAR IN TACKLING ALL ASPECTS OF DRUG PROBLEMS.  

*	WE WILL CONTINUE THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS THROUGH A COORDINATED APPROACH:  
BEING TOUGH ON PUSHERS;  REDUCING DEMAND BY EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE;  TACKLING 
DRUG ABUSE AT LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH DRUG ACTION TEAMS;  SAYING "NO" TO LEGALISING 
DRUGS;  AND WORKING WITH INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO 
RESIST THE MENACE SPREADING.

THIS PERNICIOUS EVIL HAS TO BE FOUGHT BY ALL OF US.

















	A CONFIDENT, UNITED AND SOVEREIGN NATION


OUR RECORD - THE NATION

*	MANY OF OUR OLD CITIES HAVE BEEN REJUVENATED THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP OF 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT.

*	THE AREA OF GREEN BELT HAS DOUBLED SINCE 1979.

* 	WATER AND AIR QUALITY IN THE UK HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. 

* 	WE ARE ONE OF ONLY A FEW NATIONS ON COURSE TO MEET OUR COMMITMENT TO 
RETURN EMISSIONS OF ALL GREENHOUSE GASSES TO 1990 LEVELS BY 2000. 

* 	THE LOTTERY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN THE WORLD - 
RAISING (POUND)3 BILLION FOR GOOD CAUSES IN A LITTLE OVER 2 YEARS.

*	MORE SUPPORT IS NOW GIVEN TO ARTS AND HERITAGE THAN AT ANY TIME IN OUR 
NATION'S HISTORY. WE NOW PROVIDE NEARLY 20% MORE FOR THE ARTS THAN THE LAST 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT, OVER AND ABOVE INFLATION.

*	BRITISH TALENT WAS THIS YEAR NOMINATED FOR 30 OSCARS.  BRITISH MUSIC IS 
AGAIN RECEIVING INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM.  THE INDUSTRY IS WORTH (POUND)2.5 
BILLION, MORE THAN SHIPBUILDING OR ELECTRIC COMPONENTS:  ONE IN 5 CDS AND 
RECORDS SOLD ANYWHERE HAS A BRITISH CONNECTION.

*	THERE IS RECORD INVESTMENT IN OUR SPORTS FACILITIES. ALREADY THE LOTTERY 
HAS PROVIDED (POUND)480 MILLION FOR SPORT, INCLUDING THE PLANNED BRITISH ACADEMY 
OF SPORT, ENGLISH NATIONAL STADIUM AND FOR THE FIRST TIME DIRECT FUNDING FOR 
BRITISH ATHLETES. 

* 	WE HAVE CONTINUED TO STAND UP FOR BRITISH INTERESTS IN EUROPE, PROTECTING 
OUR OPT-OUT OF THE SOCIAL CHAPTER, MAINTAINING OUR BORDER CONTROLS, AND 
PRESERVING OUR BUDGET REBATE - WORTH (POUND)18 BILLION SINCE IT WAS INTRODUCED. 

* 	WE HAVE THE MOST PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE 
MODERNISED OUR NUCLEAR DETERRENT BY REPLACING POLARIS WITH TRIDENT.




8.	THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO LIVE

BRITAIN IS ADMIRED THE WORLD OVER.  EVERY YEAR, MILLIONS OF TOURISTS TRAVEL HERE 
TO ENJOY OUR HERITAGE AND CULTURE, OUR CITIES AND COUNTRYSIDE, OUR WAY OF LIFE.  
OUR NATION'S HISTORY IS AN ANCHOR IN A SEA OF CHANGE.  WE NEED TO PROTECT, 
CHERISH AND BUILD UPON WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT OUR COUNTRY, SO OUR CHILDREN GROW UP 
IN A BETTER BRITAIN.  WE ALSO MUST MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE, WHEREVER THEY LIVE, 
HAS THE SUPPORT OF A STRONG, TOLERANT AND CIVILISED COMMUNITY.  

OUR AIM IS FOR THIS GENERATION AND FUTURE GENERATIONS TO TAKE PRIDE IN BRITAIN 
AS THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO LIVE.

BRITAIN'S CITIES
LONDON IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST CITIES.  IT IS LIVELIER THAN EVER.  OUR 
VISION OF ITS FUTURE IS SET OUT IN A SEPARATE MANIFESTO.

MANY OF OUR CITIES HAVE UNDERGONE A COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION OVER THE LAST 
DECADE.  WE HAVE PROMOTED PARTNERSHIPS - THROUGH SCHEMES SUCH AS URBAN 
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, THE SINGLE REGENERATION BUDGET AND CITY PRIDE TO 
ATTRACT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND INVESTMENT BACK TO INNER-CITIES.  THESE 
INITIATIVES ARE BRINGING HOPE, OPPORTUNITY, AND PROSPERITY TO WHAT WERE ONCE 
WASTELANDS OF URBAN DECLINE.

AS THE COUNTRY THRIVES AND BECOMES MORE PROSPEROUS, ONE OF OUR CENTRAL TASKS IS 
TO APPLY THE SAME APPROACH TO TRANSFORM THE LEGACY OF SOULLESS, DECAYING PUBLIC 
HOUSING ESTATES.  THEY ARE PLACES THAT SUFFER FROM THE VERY WORST KIND OF 
POVERTY - POVERTY OF ASPIRATION.

WE HAVE ALREADY MADE A START - SPENDING OVER (POUND)2BN OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS 
ON IMPROVING 500 OF THE WORST ESTATES.  AND WE HAVE SHOWN HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO 
TACKLE THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS ALONGSIDE NEW INVESTMENT IN BUILDINGS - 
WHERE POSSIBLE, BRINGING IN A GREATER MIX OF PUBLIC TENANTS AND PRIVATE HOUSING 
TO RECREATE A MORE BALANCED COMMUNITY.  NOW WE WILL EXTEND THIS APPROACH, 
FOCUSING THE SINGLE REGENERATION BUDGET TO LAUNCH A COMBINED ATTACK ON CRIME, 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNDER-ACHIEVEMENT, AND DEVELOPING THE GOVERNMENT'S PARTNERSHIP 
WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO HELP FUND THE MASSIVE INVESTMENT THAT WILL BE 
REQUIRED.  

*	OVER THE NEXT DECADE, WE AIM TO RAISE SOME (POUND)25BN OF NEW PRIVATE 
INVESTMENT IN HOUSING ESTATES BY ENCOURAGING TENANTS IN MORE THAN HALF OF THE 
REMAINING PUBLIC SECTOR HOUSING STOCK TO OPT FOR TRANSFERRING THEIR HOMES TO NEW 
LANDLORDS.  THESE TRANSFERS WILL ONLY OCCUR WHERE TENANTS CHOOSE THIS ROUTE TO 
IMPROVE THEIR ESTATES.

*	WE WILL USE THIS APPROACH TO REGENERATE THE WORST HOUSING ESTATES AND 
TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO LIVE ON THEM - TARGETING SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMMES 
TO IMPROVE EDUCATION STANDARDS, EMPLOYMENT AND CRIME PREVENTION ALONGSIDE NEW 
PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT.

AS WELL AS THIS ATTACK ON POOR HOUSING, WE WILL CONTINUE TO HELP THE HOMELESS.   
WE WILL CARRY THROUGH OUR PLANNED EXTENSION OF THE ROUGH SLEEPER INITIATIVE FROM 
LONDON TO OTHER BIG CITIES.  

*	WE WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT HOSTEL PLACES TO ENSURE THAT NO-ONE NEEDS SLEEP 
OUT ON THE STREETS.

RURAL COMMUNITIES
BRITAIN IS BLESSED WITH SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE IN EUROPE. 

*	WE NEED TO PROTECT THE BEST OF COUNTRYSIDE WHILST ENSURING GOOD JOBS, AND 
LIVING CONDITIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE.

WE HAVE TO STRIKE A BALANCE: OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES MUST NOT BECOME RURAL 
MUSEUMS, BUT REMAIN VIBRANT PLACES TO LIVE AND WORK.  WE WILL MAKE SURE 
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT BALANCE IS KEPT.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE GREEN BELT FROM DEVELOPMENT MAKING SURE THAT 
DERELICT AND UNDER-USED URBAN LAND IS DEVELOPED IN PREFERENCE TO GREENFIELD 
SITES. 

*	WE WILL USE THE PLANNING SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT MORE NEW HOMES ARE BUILT ON 
RECLAIMED SITES IN OUR TOWNS AND CITIES.  WE WILL AIM FOR MORE THAN 60 PER CENT 
OF ALL NEW HOMES TO BE BUILT ON DERELICT SITES.

THIS WILL REDUCE THE PRESSURE TO BUILD IN OUR COUNTRYSIDE AND EXPAND CHOICE 
WHERE IT IS NEEDED MOST.  

WE WILL SUPPORT OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES, BY GIVING SPECIAL RATE SUPPORT TO SMALL 
VILLAGE SHOPS AND POST OFFICES.  THE PLANNING SYSTEM CAN DO MORE TO HELP TOO. 

*	WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW RURAL BUSINESS USE CLASS TO ENCOURAGE JOB CREATION 
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.

*	WE WILL INCREASE SUPPORT FOR SCHEMES WHICH PROMOTE CARE FOR THE 
COUNTRYSIDE - LIKE COUNTRYSIDE STEWARDSHIP.
WE BELIEVE PARTICIPATION IN TRADITIONAL COUNTRY PURSUITS, INCLUDING FISHING, IS 
A MATTER FOR INDIVIDUALS.  A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT INTRODUCE 
LEGISLATION THAT INTERFERES WITH THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO TAKE PART IN THESE 
ACTIVITIES.

WE WILL ALSO ENCOURAGE MANAGED PUBLIC ACCESS TO PRIVATE LAND - IN AGREEMENT WITH 
FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS - BUT STRONGLY RESIST A GENERAL RIGHT TO ROAM, WHICH 
WOULD DAMAGE THE COUNTRYSIDE AND VIOLATE THE RIGHT TO PRIVATE PROPERTY.

WE AIM TO DOUBLE BRITAIN'S FOREST COVER OVER THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS.  WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE TREE PLANTING BY TARGETING GRANTS, ENCOURAGING INVESTMENT 
IN WOOD PROCESSING, AND USING NEW FREEDOMS WITH THE REFORM OF THE COMMON 
AGRICULTURAL POLICY.

AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES
WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ROBUST SUPPORT TO THE BRITISH BEEF INDUSTRY THROUGH 
THE BSE CRISIS UNTIL ITS LONG TERM STRENGTH IS RESTORED.  WE WILL VIGOROUSLY 
PURSUE THE ERADICATION OF BSE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING 
SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.  WE WILL SPARE NO EFFORTS IN OUR FIGHT 
AGAINST THE UNWARRANTED BAN ON BRITISH BEEF EXPORTS.

PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY HAVE BEEN THE GOVERNMENT'S TOP PRIORITIES 
THROUGHOUT THE BSE CRISES.

*	WE WILL TIGHTEN UP CONTROL OVER FOOD SAFETY BY APPOINTING A POWERFUL AND 
INDEPENDENT CHIEF FOOD SAFETY ADVISER AND FOOD SAFETY COUNCIL TO ADVISE 
GOVERNMENT.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL 
POLICY, MOVING AWAY FROM PRODUCTION SUPPORT TO MEASURES THAT WILL GIVE OUR 
FARMERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE WHILE SAFEGUARDING THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT.  WE 
WILL ENSURE THAT NO CHANGE TO THE COMMON AGRICULTURE POLICY UNFAIRLY 
DISADVANTAGES BRITISH FARMERS.

FISHING IS A VITAL INDUSTRY IN MANY PARTS OF COASTAL BRITAIN.  WE WILL CONTINUE 
OUR FIGHT TO SECURE A PROSPEROUS LONG TERM FUTURE FOR THE INDUSTRY AND 
SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF OUR FISH STOCKS.

*	WE WILL INSIST AT THE IGC AND ELSEWHERE ON MEASURES TO STOP QUOTA HOPPING 
AND PREVENT THE VESSELS OF OTHER COUNTRIES FROM USING UK FISHING QUOTAS.

THE INTEGRITY OF OUR 6 AND 12 MILE FISHING LIMITS IS NOT NEGOTIABLE.  WE REJECT 
ANY IDEA OF A SINGLE EUROPEAN FISHING FLEET.

WE BELIEVE THAT FISHERMEN SHOULD HAVE MORE SAY IN DECISIONS AFFECTING THEIR 
INDUSTRY.  WE WILL PRESS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH REGIONAL 
COMMITTEES TO GIVE FISHERMEN A DIRECT INFLUENCE IN FISHING POLICY.  WE WILL USE 
THESE COMMITTEES TO DEVELOP NEW WAYS OF MANAGING QUOTA AND REGULATING FISHERIES 
WHICH ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE INDUSTRY'S NEEDS.

ANIMAL WELFARE
A CIVILISED SOCIETY RESPECTS ITS ANIMALS.  BRITAIN WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE THE 
LEAD IN IMPROVING STANDARDS OF ANIMAL WELFARE IN EUROPE.  IN 1995 WE SECURED A 
MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN THE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS IN TRANSPORT;  IN 1996 WE WON 
VICTORY IN OUR CAMPAIGN TO BAN VEAL CRATES THROUGHOUT THE EU.  WE ARE DETERMINED 
THAT STANDARDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO RISE AND THAT ALL EU COUNTRIES SHOULD HAVE TO 
MEET THEM.

*	WE WILL SEEK TO ENSURE THAT ALL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE TO RAISE ANIMAL 
WELFARE STANDARDS.

WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY RISKS WITH RABIES.  THERE MAY HOWEVER BE WAYS OTHER 
THAN QUARANTINE WHICH MAINTAIN OR INCREASE PROTECTION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH, WHILE 
IMPROVING THE WELFARE OF PETS AND REDUCING THE COSTS TO TRAVELLERS.

*	WE WILL PUBLISH A GREEN PAPER ON RABIES PROTECTION, SETTING OUT ALL THE 
OPTIONS INCLUDING THE EXISTING CONTROLS, EARLY IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT.

BRITAIN'S ENVIRONMENT
BRITAIN HAS AN ENVIABLE TRACK RECORD IN PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT.  OUR RIVERS, 
BEACHES AND  WATER ARE CLEANER AND WE ARE USING OUR ENERGY MORE EFFICIENTLY.   
WE ARE LEADING THE WORLD IN REDUCING THE LEVEL OF THE "GREENHOUSE GASES" THAT 
CAUSE GLOBAL WARMING AND PRESSING FOR POLICIES THAT WILL ENABLE THE WORLD TO 
SUSTAIN DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT LONG-TERM DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT.  OUR GREEN 
MANIFESTO IS PUBLISHED SEPARATELY.

WE HAVE CLEAR OBJECTIVES TO BUILD ON THIS RECORD.  WE WILL SET TOUGH, BUT 
AFFORDABLE TARGETS, WITH PUBLISHED ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE AIR 
QUALITY AND BANISH CITY SMOG - WITH TIGHTER STANDARDS ON VEHICLE EMISSIONS AND 
POLLUTION CRACKDOWNS AROUND THE COUNTRY.  WE AIM FOR SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENTS IN 
WATER QUALITY, AT A PACE WHICH INDUSTRY AND CONSUMERS CAN AFFORD.  WE WILL 
DEVELOP LABELLING OF PRODUCTS THAT GIVES CONSUMERS INFORMATION TO SHOW THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF HOW THEY WERE MADE. 

IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE TAX SYSTEM AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO 
ENCOURAGE THE USE OF VEHICLES AND FUEL WHICH DO NOT POLLUTE THE ENVIRONMENT.  
AND, WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE POLICIES BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF POLLUTER 
PAYS: THOSE WHO CONTAMINATE LAND, POLLUTE THE ENVIRONMENT OR PRODUCE HARMFUL 
WASTE SHOULD BE MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND PAY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES.  

BRITAIN - A TOLERANT COUNTRY
TOLERANCE, CIVILITY AND RESPECT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HALLMARKS OF OUR NATION.  IT IS 
THANKS TO THEM THAT WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT RECORD ON RACE RELATIONS.

EVERYBODY, REGARDLESS OF COLOUR OR CREED, HAS THE RIGHT TO GO ABOUT HIS OR HER 
LIFE FREE FROM THE THREAT OF INTIMIDATION.  WE ARE TAKING TOUGH ACTION TO TACKLE 
HARASSMENT.  UNDER PROPOSALS IN THE PROTECTION FROM HARASSMENT ACT 1997, IT WILL 
BE A CRIME TO BEHAVE IN A WAY WHICH CAUSES SOMEONE ELSE TO BE HARASSED.  THE 
MAXIMUM PENALTY WILL BE 6 MONTHS IN PRISON.

FIRM, BUT FAIR, IMMIGRATION CONTROLS UNDERPIN GOOD RACE RELATIONS.  WE WILL 
ENSURE THAT, WHILE GENUINE ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE TREATED SYMPATHETICALLY, PEOPLE DO 
NOT ABUSE THESE PROVISIONS TO AVOID NORMAL IMMIGRATION CONTROLS.

A WORLD LEADER OF SPORTS, ARTS AND CULTURE
BRITAIN IS ENJOYING A CULTURAL RENAISSANCE.  BRITISH MUSIC, FILMS, TELEVISION, 
FASHION, ART AND  FOOD  ARE WINNING PLAUDITS THE WORLD OVER.  THEY ADD 
EXCITEMENT, FUN AND ENJOYMENT TO OUR LIVES.  OUR SUCCESS BRINGS PRIDE TO 
EVERYONE. 

THE NATIONAL LOTTERY, WHICH JOHN MAJOR SET UP, WILL PUMP BILLIONS OF POUNDS INTO 
BRITAIN'S GOOD CAUSES.  ITS PROCEEDS WILL WEAVE A NEW, RICH THREAD OF 
OPPORTUNITY AND CHARITY INTO THE TAPESTRY OF BRITISH LIFE.  IN ADDITION TO 
BENEFITTING MAJOR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, ABOUT HALF OF THE AWARDS ARE FOR 
AMOUNTS UNDER (POUND)25,000 - BENEFITTING  LOCAL COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE 
COUNTRY.  WE WILL ENCOURAGE NEW WAYS OF DISTRIBUTING AWARDS TO SUPPORT THE 
PERFORMING ARTS - THROUGH SUPPORT FOR AMATEUR PRODUCTIONS AND COMMUNITY EVENTS, 
PROVIDING MORE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, AND HELPING PRODUCTIONS TOUR ROUND THE 
COUNTRY.

THE NATIONAL LOTTERY WILL ALSO HELP US TRAIN AND PROMOTE BRITISH SPORTING 
TALENT.  THE ENGLISH NATIONAL STADIUM AND BRITISH ACADEMY OF SPORT, FUNDED BY 
THE LOTTERY, WILL BE NEW FOCAL POINTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND EXCELLENCE.  WE 
WILL ENCOURAGE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE PLAY SPORT, BY ENSURING EVERY SCHOOL PLAYS A 
MINIMUM LEVEL OF SPORT,  INCLUDING COMPETITIVE SPORTS, AND DEVELOPING A NETWORK 
OF SPORTING AMBASSADORS - SPORTING CELEBRITIES WHO WILL VISIT SCHOOLS TO INSPIRE 
YOUNG PEOPLE.  WE ALSO ENCOURAGE THE SPORTS COUNCIL TO USE LOTTERY MONEY TO 
EMPLOY OVER 1000 ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY SPORTS COACHES TO ASSIST IN PRIMARY 
SCHOOLS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG TALENT IS IMPORTANT IN ALL FIELDS.

*	WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE USE OF LOTTERY MONEY TO TRAIN YOUNG ATHLETES AND 
ARTISTS, WITH REVENUE FUNDING FOR BURSARIES, CONCESSIONARY TICKETS TO 
PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCES AND SUPPORT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE'S ORGANISATIONS AND 
PRODUCTIONS.

THE LOTTERY WILL ALSO FUND OUR MILLENNIUM CELEBRATIONS.  THEY WILL BE 
INSPIRATIONAL AS WELL AS ENJOYABLE.  WE WANT THESE BE A SHOWCASE OF BRITISH 
EXCELLENCE. BRITAIN WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK ON PAST ACHIEVEMENTS WITH PRIDE, 
AND LOOK FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE.

9.	EUROPE AND THE WORLD

BRITAIN IS A WORLD LEADER AS WELL AS A EUROPEAN NATION.  OUR ECONOMIC STRENGTH, 
OUR HISTORY AND OUR LANGUAGE MAKE US A GLOBAL TRADING NATION WITH LINKS RIGHT 
AROUND THE WORLD.  ONLY THE UNITED KINGDOM IS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL, THE COMMONWEALTH, NATO AND THE GROUP OF 
SEVEN LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS.  IN THE GULF, BOSNIA, CYPRUS AND NORTHERN 
IRAQ, JOHN MAJOR HAS SHOWN HOW OUR NATION CAN CONTRIBUTE TO WORLD PEACE.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS TO SECURE PEACE AND 
STABILITY IN AREAS OF TENSION SUCH AS FORMER YUGOSLAVIA;  IN KASHMIR;  IN 
CYPRUS;  AND IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE WILL PROMOTE REFORM OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
TO MAKE IT A MORE EFFECTIVE ORGANISATION FOR SECURING INTERNATIONAL STABILITY.  
BRITAIN WILL CONTINUE TO DEPLOY OUR OUTSTANDING ARMED FORCES AS PEACEKEEPERS 
UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS.  AND WE WILL SUPPORT THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE POLES, 
CZECHS, HUNGARIANS AND OTHERS TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NATO.  

AFTER THE TRANSFER OF HONG KONG, WE WILL WORK UNDER THE TERMS OF THE JOINT 
DECLARATION TO HELP SUSTAIN THE PROSPERITY AND WAY OF LIFE OF THE PEOPLE OF HONG 
KONG AND BUILD ON THE SUBSTANTIAL BRITISH INTERESTS THAT WILL REMAIN.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE COMMONWEALTH, OUR UNIQUE GLOBAL NETWORK, TO 
ENCOURAGE THE SPREAD OF DEMOCRACY, AS SET OUT IN THE HARARE DECLARATION.  WE 
WILL FOCUS OUR AID PROGRAMME TO ENCOURAGE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN COUNTRIES 
THAT ARE GROWING TOWARDS SELF SUFFICIENCY UNDER DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.  WE HAVE 
TAKEN THE LEAD IN ALLEVIATING THE BURDEN OF DEBT FOR THE WORLD'S POOREST 
COUNTRIES.  WE ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLOWS OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO DEVELOPING 
ECONOMIES.  WE ARE MORE THAN ACHIEVING THE LONG TERM UN TARGET OF 1% OF GDP FOR 
THE TRANSFER OF WEALTH TO LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
MAINTAIN A SIGNIFICANT BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL AID PROGRAMME REFLECTING THE 
ASPIRATION OF MEETING THE UN'S TARGET OF 0.7% OF GDP FOR AID AS A LONG-TERM 
OBJECTIVE.

WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN EUROPE AND INTERNATIONALLY ON 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, BUILDING ON THE RIO CONFERENCE TO ENCOURAGE SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT - MEETING OUR COMMITMENT TO REDUCE CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS BY 
10% ON 1990 LEVELS BY 2010 TO PREVENT CLIMATE CHANGE.  THE PRIME MINISTER HAS 
COMMITTED HIMSELF TO ATTENDING THE NEXT UN ENVIRONMENTAL CONFERENCE IN JUNE.

BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN UNION
WE BELIEVE THAT IN AN UNCERTAIN, COMPETITIVE WORLD, THE NATION STATE IS A ROCK 
OF SECURITY.  A NATION'S COMMON HERITAGE, CULTURE, VALUES AND OUTLOOK ARE A 
PRECIOUS SOURCE OF STABILITY. NATIONHOOD GIVES PEOPLE A SENSE OF BELONGING.  

THE GOVERNMENT HAS A POSITIVE VISION FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A PARTNERSHIP OF 
NATIONS. WE WANT TO BE IN EUROPE BUT NOT RUN BY EUROPE.  WE HAVE MUCH TO GAIN 
FROM OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION - IN TRADE, IN CO-OPERATION BETWEEN 
GOVERNMENTS, AND IN PRESERVING EUROPEAN PEACE.  WE BENEFIT FROM THE HUGE TRADE 
OPPORTUNITIES THAT HAVE OPENED UP SINCE BRITAIN LED THE WAY IN DEVELOPING 
EUROPE'S SINGLE MARKET.  WE WANT TO SEE THE REST OF EUROPE FOLLOW THE SAME 
DEREGULATED, ENTERPRISE POLICIES THAT HAVE TRANSFORMED OUR ECONOMIC PROSPECTS IN 
BRITAIN.

HOWEVER, IN JUNE, THE NATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL GATHER IN AMSTERDAM TO 
NEGOTIATE POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS TO THE TREATY OF ROME.  IT IS A MOMENT OF TRUTH, 
SETTING THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL GO.  IT WILL ALSO BE 
CRUCIAL IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REST OF EUROPE WITH 
WHICH WE CAN BE COMFORTABLE. 

*	A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL SEEK A PARTNERSHIP OF NATION STATES.  SOME 
OTHERS WOULD LIKE TO BUILD A FEDERAL EUROPE.  A BRITISH CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 
WILL NOT ALLOW BRITAIN TO BE PART OF A FEDERAL EUROPEAN STATE.

THE DIVERSITY OF EUROPE'S NATIONS IS ITS STRENGTH.  AS MORE NATIONS JOIN THE 
EUROPEAN UNION, IT NEEDS TO BECOME FLEXIBLE NOT MORE RIGID.  WE MUST ALSO ENSURE 
THAT ANY DEVELOPMENTS WHICH ONLY INCLUDE SOME MEMBERS DO NOT WORK TO THE 
DISADVANTAGE OF OTHERS.  

OUR PRIORITIES FOR EUROPE'S DEVELOPMENT WILL BE ENLARGEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY, 
COMPLETION OF THE SINGLE MARKET, REFORM OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE, AND 
FURTHER STRENGTHENING OF THE ROLE OF NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS.  WE WILL SEEK MORE 
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS ON AREAS OF COMMON INTEREST - DEFENCE, 
FOREIGN POLICY AND THE FIGHT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL CRIME AND DRUGS.  WE ALSO 
BELIEVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ITSELF SHOULD DO LESS, BUT DO IT BETTER.  SO WE HAVE 
PROPOSED INCORPORATING THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY - THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION 
SHOULD ONLY DO THAT WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY MEMBER STATES ACTING ALONE - INTO 
THE TREATY.  THIS IS HOW WE ARE APPROACHING THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE.

*	WE WILL ARGUE FOR A FLEXIBLE EUROPE WHICH FULLY ACCOMMODATES THE INTERESTS 
AND ASPIRATIONS OF ALL ITS MEMBER STATES AND WHERE ANY NEW PROPOSALS HAVE TO BE 
OPEN TO ALL AND AGREED BY ALL.  WE WILL NOT ACCEPT OTHER CHANGES TO THE TREATY 
THAT WOULD FURTHER CENTRALISE DECISION-MAKING, REDUCE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, OR 
REMOVE OUR RIGHT TO PERMANENT OPT-OUTS.

*	WE WILL RETAIN BRITAIN'S VETO AND OPPOSE FURTHER EXTENSION OF QUALIFIED 
MAJORITY VOTING IN ORDER TO ENSURE WE CAN PREVENT POLICIES THAT WOULD BE HARMFUL 
TO THE NATIONAL INTEREST.  WE WILL DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS AND 
OPPOSE MORE POWERS BEING GIVEN TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AT THE EXPENSE OF 
NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS.

*	WE WILL TAKE WHATEVER STEPS ARE NECESSARY TO KEEP OUR FRONTIER CONTROLS.  
WE WILL RESIST ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE THE INTER-GOVERNMENTAL NATURE OF COOPERATION 
IN JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS.  WE WILL NOT ACCEPT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LEGAL 
RIGHTS THAT EXTEND THE CONCEPT OF EUROPEAN CITIZENSHIP.

BRITAIN'S REBATE HAS SO FAR SAVED BRITISH TAXPAYERS (POUND)18BN AND WE WILL 
PROTECT IT.

ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES EUROPE FACES IS TO CUT UNEMPLOYMENT AND MAKE ITS 
BUSINESSES COMPETITIVE.  HERE BRITAIN IS LEADING THE WAY.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
ARGUE FOR DEREGULATION AND LOWER COSTS ON EUROPE'S BUSINESSES,  THE POLICIES 
THAT HAVE HELPED GIVE BRITAIN ONE OF THE STRONGEST ECONOMIES IN EUROPE.  WE WILL 
NOT PUT THAT ACHIEVEMENT AT RISK BY SIGNING UP TO THE SOCIAL CHAPTER, WHICH 
WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO IMPOSING THE HIGH COSTS OF THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL MODEL ON 
BRITISH BUSINESS.  ONCE BRITAIN ACCEPTED THE SOCIAL CHAPTER WE COULD NOT STOP 
MANY OF THESE DAMAGING POLICIES BEING IMPOSED ON US BY QUALIFIED MAJORITY 
VOTING.

WE WILL INSIST THAT ANY NEW TREATY RECOGNISES THAT OUR OPT OUT FROM THE SOCIAL 
CHAPTER ENABLES BRITAIN TO BE EXEMPT FROM THE WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE, AND 
PREVENTS ANY ABUSE OF OUR OPT OUT.  AND, WE WILL NOT ACCEPT A NEW EMPLOYMENT 
CHAPTER IN ANY REVISED TREATY, WHICH WOULD EXPOSE BRITISH BUSINESSES TO NEW 
COSTS.  

WE MADE IT CLEAR IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR 
FURTHER REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, AND THE LIFTING OF THE 
WORLDWIDE BAN ON BRITISH BEEF, AND INSIST ON MEASURES TO STOP QUOTA HOPPING BY 
FOREIGN FISHING VESSELS.  

PROTECTING BRITAIN'S INTERESTS DEMANDS TOUGH, EXPERIENCED NEGOTIATION. JOHN 
MAJOR HAS PROVED HE HAS THESE QUALITIES - INCLUDING THE RESOLVE TO SAY NO WHEN 
NECESSARY EVEN IF THAT MEANS BEING ISOLATED.  LABOUR HAVE SAID THEY WOULD NEVER 
WANT BRITAIN TO BE ISOLATED IN EUROPE: THEY WOULD DAMAGE BRITAIN'S SUCCESS BY 
UNDERMINING OUR VETO, SIGNING UP TO THE SOCIAL CHAPTER AND FOLLOWING IN OTHERS' 
FOOTSTEPS - EVEN WHERE THEY LEAD IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.  THEY SUPPORT POLICIES 
THAT WOULD FRAGMENT THE UNITED KINGDOM'S INFLUENCE WITHIN A EUROPE OF REGIONS.  
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WELCOME THE END OF THE NATION STATE.  ONLY THE 
CONSERVATIVES CAN BE TRUSTED TO STAND UP FOR BRITAIN IN EUROPE: OUR NATIONAL 
INTEREST MUST BE PROTECTED.

A SINGLE CURRENCY:  OUR REFERENDUM GUARANTEE
THE CREATION OF A EUROPEAN SINGLE CURRENCY WOULD BE OF ENORMOUS SIGNIFICANCE FOR 
ALL EUROPEAN STATES WHETHER THEY ARE MEMBERS OR NOT.  WE MUST TAKE ACCOUNT OF 
ALL THE CONSEQUENCES FOR BRITAIN OF SUCH A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY.


JOHN MAJOR SECURED FOR US AT MAASTRICHT AN OPT-OUT FROM THE COMMITMENT TO ENTER 
A SINGLE CURRENCY.  IT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF THIS OPT-OUT THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
NEGOTIATE AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER IT IS IN BRITAIN'S INTEREST TO JOIN.  

IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST TO TAKE PART IN THE NEGOTIATIONS. NOT TO DO SO 
WOULD BE AN ABDICATION OF RESPONSIBILITY.  A SINGLE CURRENCY WOULD AFFECT US 
WHETHER WE WERE IN OR OUT.  WE NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSIONS IN ORDER TO 
ENSURE THE RULES ARE NOT FIXED AGAINST OUR INTERESTS.  THE NATIONAL INTEREST IS 
NOT SERVED BY EXERCISING OUR OPTION - ONE WAY OR THE OTHER - BEFORE WE HAVE TO.

FOR A SINGLE CURRENCY TO COME INTO EFFECT, EUROPEAN ECONOMIES WILL HAVE TO MEET 
CRUCIAL CRITERIA. ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS 
VERY UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT CONVERGENCE OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
ACROSS EUROPE FOR A SINGLE CURRENCY TO PROCEED SAFELY ON THE TARGET DATE OF 
JANUARY 1ST 1999.  WE WILL NOT INCLUDE LEGISLATION ON THE SINGLE CURRENCY IN THE 
FIRST QUEEN'S SPEECH. IF IT CANNOT PROCEED SAFELY, WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BETTER 
FOR EUROPE TO DELAY ANY INTRODUCTION OF A SINGLE CURRENCY RATHER THAN RUSH AHEAD 
TO MEET AN ARTIFICIAL TIMETABLE.  WE WILL ARGUE THIS CASE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS 
THAT LIE AHEAD.

*	WE BELIEVE IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST TO KEEP OUR OPTIONS OPEN TO TAKE 
A DECISION ON A SINGLE CURRENCY WHEN ALL THE FACTS ARE BEFORE US.  IF A SINGLE 
CURRENCY IS CREATED, WITHOUT SUSTAINABLE CONVERGENCE, A BRITISH CONSERVATIVE 
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BE PART OF IT.  

*	IF, DURING THE COURSE OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT, A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 
WERE TO CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST TO JOIN A SINGLE CURRENCY, 
WE HAVE GIVEN A GUARANTEE THAT NO SUCH DECISION WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED UNLESS THE 
BRITISH PEOPLE GAVE THEIR EXPRESS APPROVAL IN A REFERENDUM.

DEFENCE IN AN UNSTABLE WORLD
THE OLD RIVALRIES OF THE COLD WAR HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY NEW TENSIONS.  BRITAIN 
MUST BE ABLE TO REACT RAPIDLY TO PROTECT OUR SECURITY AND INTERESTS AROUND THE 
GLOBE.

OUR ARMED FORCES ARE THE MOST PROFESSIONAL IN THE WORLD.  WE HAVE CUT 
UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRACY AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY, AND DIRECTED MONEY TO SUPPORT 
OUR SERVICES IN THE FRONTLINE.  WE HAVE MADE THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO ADAPT OUR 
SERVICES TO THE THREATS WHICH WE MIGHT NOW FACE.  WE HAVE SET OUT DEFENCE PLANS 
BASED ON STABLE LEVELS OF FUNDING.  THERE IS NO NEED FOR A DEFENCE REVIEW, WHICH 
WOULD RAISE FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENSURE THE SERVICES HAVE THE MODERN WEAPONS THEY NEED TO 
GUARANTEE THEIR SUPERIORITY AGAINST POTENTIAL AGGRESSORS.  WE WILL MAKE SURE WE 
CAN CONDUCT MILITARY OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND DEVELOP OUR CAPABILITY 
TO DEPLOY THE THREE SERVICES TOGETHER AND RAPIDLY, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO 
TRANSPORT HEAVY EQUIPMENT INTO AN OPERATIONAL ZONE.  WE WILL TAKE PART IN 
BALLISTIC MISSILE RESEARCH SO WE CAN DECIDE WHETHER WE SHOULD PROCURE ANY SUCH 
SYSTEM FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET OUR EFFORTS ON RECRUITING FOR THE ARMED FORCES.  WE 
WILL SET UP AN ARMY FOUNDATION COLLEGE, WHICH WILL PROVIDE 1,300 PLACES FOR 16 
AND 17 YEAR OLDS WHO WANT TO JOIN THE ARMY.  WE WILL ALSO ENABLE THE RESERVE 
FORCES TO PLAY A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN OPERATIONS.  WE APPRECIATE THE ENORMOUS 
VALUE OF CADET FORCES, AND OUR CURRENT PLANS INCLUDING RESOURCES TO ENCOURAGE 
THEIR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT BRITAIN'S DEFENCE INDUSTRY, AND WE WILL WORK WITH 
COMPANIES TO IDENTIFY THE TECHNOLOGIES OF THE FUTURE.

NATO WILL REMAIN THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR SECURITY. WE WILL RESIST ATTEMPTS TO 
BRING THE WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND 
ENSURE THAT DEFENCE POLICY REMAINS A MATTER FOR SOVEREIGN NATIONS.   





10. THE CONSTITUTION

ALONE IN EUROPE, THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS BEEN ONE OF STABILITY AND 
SECURITY.  WE OWE MUCH OF THAT TO THE STRENGTH AND STABILITY OF OUR CONSTITUTION 
- THE INSTITUTIONS, LAWS AND TRADITIONS THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS A NATION.

OUR CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN STABLE, BUT NOT STATIC.  IT HAS BEEN WOVEN OVER THE 
CENTURIES - THE PRODUCT OF HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE AND 
HISTORY.  

RADICAL CHANGES THAT ALTER THE WHOLE CHARACTER OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE 
COULD UNRAVEL WHAT GENERATIONS OF OUR PREDECESSORS HAVE CREATED.  TO PRESERVE 
THAT STABILITY IN FUTURE - AND THE FREEDOMS AND RIGHTS OF OUR CITIZENS - WE NEED 
TO CONTINUE A PROCESS OF EVOLUTION, NOT REVOLUTION.  

CONSERVATIVES EMBRACE EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE THAT SOLVES REAL PROBLEMS AND IMPROVES 
THE WAY OUR CONSTITUTION WORKS.  IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE OPENED UP GOVERNMENT, 
DEVOLVED POWER AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND INTRODUCED REFORMS TO MAKE PARLIAMENT 
WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY.  IT IS THAT EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
CONTINUE.

OPEN, ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT
IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO OPEN UP GOVERNMENT TO PUBLIC 
SCRUTINY, AND GIVE INDIVIDUALS MORE INFORMATION TO HOLD GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC 
SERVICES TO ACCOUNT.

WE HAVE INTRODUCED A CODE ON ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION, POLICED BY THE 
OMBUDSMAN.  WE HAVE PUBLISHED INFORMATION ON THE WORKINGS OF GOVERNMENT 
PREVIOUSLY HELD SECRET - INCLUDING THE COMPOSITION OF CABINET COMMITTEES, AND 
THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  WE HAVE INTRODUCED A 
NEW CIVIL SERVICE CODE, AND REFORMED THE PROCESS FOR PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS.  WE 
ARE PLEDGED TO LEGISLATE ON THE COMMITMENTS IN OUR 1993 WHITE PAPER ON OPEN 
GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING A STATUTORY RIGHT OF ACCESS BY CITIZENS TO PERSONAL 
RECORDS HELD ABOUT THEM BY THE GOVERNMENT AND OTHER PUBLIC AUTHORITIES.  AND WE 
HAVE SET UP THE NOLAN COMMITTEE AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED ITS PROPOSALS TO ENSURE 
THAT THE HIGHEST STANDARDS ARE MAINTAINED IN PUBLIC LIFE.

BUT OUR REFORMS GO EVEN WIDER THAN THAT.  WE HAVE TRANSFERRED POWER FROM CENTRAL 
BUREAUCRACIES TO LOCAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS SCHOOL GOVERNORS AND HOSPITAL 
TRUSTS.  WE HAVE INTRODUCED THE CITIZEN'S CHARTER.  WE HAVE ALSO REQUIRED THEM 
TO PUBLISH INFORMATION ON THEIR PERFORMANCE - INFORMATION WHICH ENABLES THE 
LOCAL COMMUNITY TO KEEP A CHECK ON STANDARDS AND APPLY PRESSURE WHERE NEEDED. 
WHEREVER POSSIBLE, WE ARE WIDENING COMPETITION AND CHOICE IN PUBLIC SERVICES.  
WE SHOWED IN CHAPTER 6 HOW WE WISHED TO PUSH THIS AGENDA FORWARD.  

REGIONAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE A DANGEROUSLY CENTRALISING MEASURE - TAKING POWER 
AWAY FROM ELECTED LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  WE WISH TO GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, 
SHIFTING POWER TO THE LOCAL NEIGHBOURHOOD - FOR EXAMPLE BY GIVING MORE POWER TO 
PARISH COUNCILS.

PARLIAMENT
PARLIAMENT - ALONGSIDE THE CROWN AND OUR LEGAL SYSTEM - IS ONE OF THE THREE KEY 
INSTITUTIONS THAT UPHOLD OUR CONSTITUTION.  THE SUPREMACY OF PARLIAMENT IS 
FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY, AND THE GUARANTEE OF OUR FREEDOMS.  THE LAST 17 
YEARS HAVE SEEN MANY CHANGES TO STRENGTHEN PARLIAMENT AND MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE 
- THE FLOURISHING OF SELECT COMMITTEES, NEW PROCEDURES TO SCRUTINISE EUROPEAN 
LEGISLATION, REFORM OF PARLIAMENT'S WORKING DAY, AND A BUDGET THAT BRINGS 
TOGETHER TAX AND SPENDING.  

WE HAVE THEREFORE ALREADY DONE MUCH TO IMPROVE THE WAY PARLIAMENT WORKS AND WILL 
DO MORE.  WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE PROPOSAL FROM THE PUBLIC SERVICE SELECT COMMITTEE 
AND PUT BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS A CLEAR NEW STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLES 
UNDERLYING MINISTERIAL ACCOUNTABILITY TO PARLIAMENT.

ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE MADE PARLIAMENT OPEN TO THE CITIZEN, AND THE 
GOVERNMENT MORE ACCOUNTABLE.  IN THE NEXT SESSION OF PARLIAMENT WE WILL CONTINUE 
THIS CAREFUL REFORM.  

*	TO GIVE PARLIAMENT MORE TIME TO CONSIDER LEGISLATION THOROUGHLY WE WILL 
EXTEND THE QUEEN'S SPEECH TO COVER NOT ONLY LEGISLATION FOR THE IMMEDIATE YEAR 
BUT ALSO PROVISIONAL PLANS FOR LEGISLATION IN THE YEAR AFTER THAT.  

THIS WILL MEAN THAT MORE DRAFT BILLS WILL BE SUBJECT TO PUBLIC SCRUTINY BEFORE 
THEY REACH THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.  IT WILL GIVE SELECT COMMITTEES 
MORE TIME TO TAKE EVIDENCE AND REPORT.  AND THIS SHOULD ALSO MEAN BETTER 
LEGISLATION.

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS A CASE FOR MORE RADICAL REFORM THAT WOULD UNDERMINE 
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.  A NEW BILL OF RIGHTS, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD RISK 
TRANSFERRING POWER AWAY FROM PARLIAMENT TO LEGAL COURTS - UNDERMINING THE 
DEMOCRATIC SUPREMACY OF PARLIAMENT AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE.  WHILST 
THIS MAY BE A NECESSARY CHECK IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH DEPEND UPON MORE 
FORMALISED WRITTEN CONSTITUTIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO THE UK.  

NOR DO WE FAVOUR CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM OF VOTING IN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS THAT 
WOULD BREAK THE LINK BETWEEN AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT AND HIS 
CONSTITUENTS.  A SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO 
PRODUCE UNSTABLE, COALITION GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE 
LEADERSHIP - WITH CRUCIAL DECISIONS BEING DEPENDENT ON COMPROMISE DEALS HAMMERED 
OUT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.  THIS IS NOT THE BRITISH WAY.  

WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED WE ARE NOT AGAINST CHANGE WHERE IT IS PRACTICAL AND 
BENEFICIAL.  BUT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY THOUGHT THROUGH - 
SUCH AS OPPOSITION PROPOSALS ON THE HOUSE OF LORDS - WOULD BE EXTREMELY 
DAMAGING.  WE WILL OPPOSE CHANGE FOR CHANGE'S SAKE.  

THE UNION
THE UNION BETWEEN SCOTLAND, WALES, NORTHERN IRELAND AND ENGLAND UNDERPINS OUR 
NATION'S STABILITY.  THE CONSERVATIVE COMMITMENT TO THE UNITED KINGDOM DOES NOT 
MEAN IGNORING THE DISTINCTIVE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS.  ON THE 
CONTRARY, WE HAVE GONE FURTHER IN RECOGNISING THAT DIVERSITY THAN ANY PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENT.  WE ARE PUBLISHING SEPARATE MANIFESTOS FOR WALES AND SCOTLAND.

WHILE PRESERVING THE ROLE OF PARLIAMENT AT THE CENTRE OF THE UNION, WE HAVE 
GIVEN NEW POWERS TO THE SCOTTISH GRAND COMMITTEE AND WELSH GRAND COMMITTEE - 
ENABLING SCOTTISH AND WELSH MPS TO CALL MINISTERS TO ACCOUNT AND DEBATE 
LEGISLATION WHICH AFFECTS THOSE COUNTRIES - SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE 
WITH SEPARATE ASSEMBLIES.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, WELSH MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT CAN 
ASK THEIR QUESTIONS TO MINISTERS IN WELSH IN WALES.  MOST RECENTLY WE HAVE 
SIMILARLY EXTENDED THE BASIC POWERS OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND GRAND COMMITTEE. 


WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO.  BY CONTRAST, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW 
ASSEMBLIES IN SCOTLAND AND WALES WOULD CREATE STRAINS WHICH COULD WELL PULL 
APART THE UNION.  THAT WOULD CREATE A NEW LAYER OF GOVERNMENT, WHICH WOULD BE 
HUNGRY FOR POWER.  IT WOULD RISK RIVALRY AND CONFLICT BETWEEN THESE PARLIAMENTS 
OR ASSEMBLIES AND THE PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER.  AND IT WOULD RAISE SERIOUS 
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE REPRESENTATION OF SCOTTISH AND WELSH MPS AT 
WESTMINSTER - AND THEIR ROLE IN MATTERS AFFECTING ENGLISH AFFAIRS - COULD REMAIN 
UNCHANGED.

NOR DO WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE IN THE INTERESTS OF THE SCOTTISH OR WELSH PEOPLE.  
A SCOTTISH TAX-RAISING PARLIAMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, COULD WELL AFFECT THE CHOICE OF 
WHERE NEW INVESTMENT LOCATES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE WANT SECURITY, NOTHING WOULD BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN TO 
UNRAVEL A CONSTITUTION THAT BINDS OUR NATION TOGETHER AND THE INSTITUTIONS THAT 
BRING US STABILITY.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THE STRENGTH AND DIVERSITY 
THAT BENEFITS ALL OF US AS A PROUD UNION OF NATIONS.

NORTHERN IRELAND
WHILE WE CHERISH THE UNION AND NORTHERN IRELAND'S PLACE WITHIN IT, WE RECOGNISE 
THAT THERE EXIST WITHIN THE PROVINCE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH REQUIRE FURTHER 
ACTION TO BE TAKEN.

AFTER A QUARTER OF A CENTURY WE WISH TO SEE THE UNIQUE AND ORIGINALLY TEMPORARY 
SYSTEM OF DIRECT RULE ENDED AND A SUCCESSFUL RESTORATION OF LOCAL ACCOUNTABLE 
DEMOCRACY ACHIEVED.  WE WANT TO SEE THIS BROUGHT ABOUT IN A FORM WHICH CARRIES 
THE BROADEST AGREEMENT POSSIBLE.  AND WE WANT TO SEE THE RIGHTS, TRADITIONS AND 
INTERESTS OF ALL PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY RECOGNISED WITHIN ANY SUCH AGREEMENT.

WE WILL ACCORDINGLY CONTINUE TO PURSUE A POLICY OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION WITH 
AND BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATIC NORTHERN IRELAND PARTIES.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
UNDERPIN SUCH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GUARANTEE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION 
OF NORTHERN IRELAND CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE CHANGED WITHOUT THE BROAD CONSENT OF 
THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND.  AT THE SAME TIME WE WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE 
WHATEVER SECURITY MEASURES ARE REQUIRED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN 
IRELAND FROM THOSE WHO SEEK TO ACHIEVE THEIR POLITICAL GOALS BY VIOLENT MEANS.

WE SEEK PEACE.  BUT WE WILL NEVER BE SWAYED BY TERRORIST VIOLENCE NOR WILL WE 
EVER COMPROMISE OUR  PRINCIPLES WITH THOSE WHO SEEK TO OVERTHROW THE RULE OF LAW 
BY FORCE.




A CHOICE OF TWO FUTURES

AT THIS ELECTION THE BRITISH PEOPLE FACE A STARK CHOICE. A CHOICE OF TWO 
FUTURES.

THEY CAN ELECT TO CONTINUE DOWN THE ROAD OF SUCCESS AND ACHIEVEMENT. AN 
OPPORTUNITY THAT HAS BEEN HARD WON BY THE EFFORTS AND SACRIFICES OF THE BRITISH 
PEOPLE. AN OPPORTUNITY THAT HAS ONLY COME ABOUT BECAUSE SUCCESSIVE  CONSERVATIVE 
GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO FACE UP TO THE LONG TERM PROBLEMS FACING 
BRITAIN, AND TAKE THE TOUGH STEPS NEEDED TO ARREST OUR SLOW DECLINE. 

OR THEY CAN ELECT TO TAKE A HUGE RISK WITH THAT FUTURE - THE FUTURE OF 
THEMSELVES, THEIR CHILDREN, THEIR NATION - BY HANDING OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
COUNTRY TO POLITICIANS WHO HAVE FOUGHT, OPPOSED AND DENIGRATED EVERY STEP THAT 
HAS BEEN TAKEN TO RESTORE BRITAIN'S ECONOMIC HEALTH AND STANDING IN THE WORLD. 
POLITICIANS WHOSE OWN DECLARED POLICIES WOULD BURDEN THE UNITED KINGDOM  WITH 
NEW SPENDING AND TAXATION, NEW REGULATIONS, AND NEW THREATS TO THE STABILITY AND 
SOVEREIGNTY OF THE NATION ITSELF.

YOU CAN ONLY BE SURE WITH THE CONSERVATIVES.








OUR VISION FOR BRITAIN:
25 PLEDGES FOR THE NATION

THE ENTERPRISE CENTRE OF EUROPE
* TAX AND SPENDING.  KEEP TIGHT CONTROL OF PUBLIC SPENDING PRIORITIES, AIMING 
FOR OUR TARGET OF A 20P BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX OVER THE NEXT PARLIAMENT.

* PRICES AND MORTGAGES.  STICK TO THE POLICIES WHICH HAVE DELIVERED THE LOWEST 
INFLATION LEVELS AND MORTGAGE RATES FOR A GENERATION, MEETING OUR INFLATION 
TARGET OF 2.5 % OR LESS.

* JOBS.  PROTECT JOBS BY KEEPING BRITAIN OUT OF THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL CHAPTER; 
BUILD ON OUR RECORD OF FALLING UNEMPLOYMENT; AND HELP GET THE LONG TERM 
UNEMPLOYED BACK TO WORK - INCLUDING BY REQUIRING THOSE ON BENEFIT FOR SOME TIME 
TO UNDERTAKE WORK EXPERIENCE ON A COMMUNITY PROJECT.

* ENTERPRISE.  SUPPORT GROWTH AND INVESTMENT BY KEEPING BRITAIN THE LOWEST TAX 
MAJOR ECONOMY IN EUROPE, PURSUING BRITAIN'S GLOBAL TRADE OPPORTUNITIES AND 
CURBING UNNECESSARY REGULATIONS.

* SMALL BUSINESS.  REFORM BUSINESS RATES TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES.

* THE FUTURE.  KEEP BRITAIN AHEAD IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE, ENCOURAGING 
NEW ENTERTAINMENT AND INFORMATION SERVICES, AND USING THE MILLENNIUM LOTTERY 
FUND TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO NEW COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION LINKS IN SCHOOLS, 
LIBRARIES, AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES.





OPPORTUNITY AND OWNERSHIP FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES

* HELP FOR FAMILIES.  GIVE PRIORITY TO REDUCING TAX BILLS FOR FAMILIES LOOKING 
AFTER DEPENDENT CHILDREN OR RELATIVES BY ALLOWING ONE PARTNER'S UNUSED PERSONAL 
ALLOWANCE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A WORKING SPOUSE WHERE THEY HAVE THESE 
RESPONSIBILITIES.

* HELP FOR CARERS.  HELP FAMILY MEMBERS WITH HEAVY RESPONSIBILITIES CARING FOR A 
RELATIVE TO TAKE A MUCH NEEDED BREAK THROUGH A NEW RESPITE CARE PROGRAMME.

* OWNERSHIP.  ENCOURAGE SCHEMES THAT HELP EMPLOYEES BUILD A SHAREHOLDING IN THE 
COMPANY THEY WORK FOR, ALONGSIDE TAX BENEFITS FOR OTHER SAVINGS SCHEMES.

* PENSIONS.  TRANSFORM PENSIONS BY PROVIDING ALL YOUNG PEOPLE ENTERING THE 
WORKFORCE WITH A PERSONAL PENSION FUND PAID FOR BY A REBATE ON THEIR NATIONAL 
INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS, WHILE MAINTAINING A STATE PENSION GUARANTEE.

* CARE IN OLD AGE.  MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO AFFORD THE COST OF CARE IN OLD 
AGE WITHOUT GIVING UP THEIR HOUSE AND SAVINGS.

* SCHOOL STANDARDS.  GUARANTEE SCHOOL STANDARDS BY INTERVENING DIRECTLY TO RAISE 
STANDARDS WHERE SCHOOLS OR LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES ARE LETTING CHILDREN 
DOWN.

* SCHOOL CHOICE.  WIDEN CHOICE AND DIVERSITY IN SCHOOLS, WITH MORE FREEDOM FOR 
SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN CHARACTER, MORE SPECIALIST SCHOOLS, AND A GRAMMAR 
SCHOOL IN EVERY TOWN WHERE PARENTS WANT THAT CHOICE.  WE WILL ALSO MAINTAIN OUR 
NURSERY VOUCHER SCHEME OFFERING A CHOICE OF PLACES FOR PARENTS OF ALL 4 YEAR 
OLDS.






WORLD CLASS HEALTH AND PUBLIC SERVICES

* NHS FUNDING PLEDGE.  CONTINUE, YEAR BY YEAR, TO INCREASE THE REAL RESOURCES 
COMMITTED TO THE NHS, SO NHS SPENDING WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE IN A GROWING 
ECONOMY.

* FAMILY DOCTORS.  ENABLE ALL FAMILY DOCTORS TO PROVIDE A WIDER RANGE OF 
SERVICES IN THEIR SURGERIES AND IN PRACTICE-BASED COTTAGE HOSPITALS - OFFERING 
FASTER AND MORE LOCAL TREATMENT.

* CITIZEN'S CHARTER.  CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE STANDARDS AND VALUE FOR MONEY OF 
BRITAIN'S PUBLIC SERVICES, GIVING THOSE WHO USE THEM MORE INFORMATION AND, WHERE 
POSSIBLE, WIDER CHOICE.

* ESSENTIAL SERVICES.  INTRODUCE MEASURES TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AGAINST STRIKES 
THAT CAUSE EXCESSIVE DISRUPTION TO ESSENTIAL SERVICES.


A SAFE AND CIVIL SOCIETY

* PUBLIC SAFETY.  SUPPORT LOCAL POLICE SCHEMES TO CRACK DOWN ON PETTY CRIME, AND 
CONTINUE OUR FUNDING FOR THE INSTALLATION OF TV SECURITY CAMERAS IN TOWN CENTRES 
AND PUBLIC PLACES THAT WANT THEM THROUGHOUT THE NEXT PARLIAMENT.

* JUVENILE CRIME.  GIVE THE COURTS POWER TO IMPOSE SPEEDY SANCTIONS ON 
YOUNGSTERS, INCLUDING AN ELEMENT OF REPARATION TO THE VICTIM; AND CONTINUE OUR 
WAR AGAINST DRUGS.

-  PERSISTENT CRIMINALS.  ENSURE PERSISTENT HOUSE BURGLARS AND DEALERS IN HARD 
DRUGS RECEIVE MANDATORY MINIMUM PRISON SENTENCES.





A CONFIDENT, UNITED AND SOVEREIGN NATION

* QUALITY OF LIFE.  CONTINUE THE RENAISSANCE OF OUR TOWNS AND CITIES, IN 
PARTICULAR HARNESSING PRIVATE CAPITAL TO REGENERATE THE WORST PUBLIC HOUSING 
ESTATES; CONTINUE TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRYSIDE AND HERITAGE; AND USE THE NATIONAL 
LOTTERY TO HELP PROMOTE BRITISH SPORTS, ARTS AND CULTURE.

* THE ENVIRONMENT.  MAINTAIN OUR INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP ROLE IN PROTECTING THE 
ENVIRONMENT, AND CONTINUE IMPROVING AIR AND WATER QUALITY AT HOME ALONGSIDE 
EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION OF OUR WILDLIFE.

* THE NATION.  MAINTAIN THE UNITY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND PRESERVE THE 
STABILITY OF THE NATION THROUGH AN EVOLUTIONARY - RATHER THAN REVOLUTIONARY - 
APPROACH TO CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.

* EUROPE.  SEEK A PARTNERSHIP OF NATION STATES IN EUROPE, AND NOT ALLOW BRITAIN 
TO BE PART OF A FEDERAL EUROPEAN STATE.

* THE POUND.  GUARANTEE THAT BRITAIN WILL NOT JOIN A SINGLE CURRENCY IN THE NEXT 
PARLIAMENT UNLESS THE BRITISH PEOPLE GIVE THEIR EXPRESS APPROVAL IN A 
REFERENDUM.  
 

*	WE WILL HARNESS PRIVATE CAPITAL TO REGENERATE THE WORST HOUSING ESTATES 
AND TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO LIVE ON THEM.

*	WE WILL SEEK A PARTNERSHIP OF NATION STATES IN EUROPE.  WE WILL NOT ALLOW 
BRITAIN TO BE PART OF A FEDERAL EUROPEAN STATE.

*	WE HAVE GIVEN A GUARANTEE THAT BRITAIN WOULD NOT JOIN A SINGLE CURRENCY IN 
THE NEXT PARLIAMENT UNLESS THE BRITISH PEOPLE GIVE THEIR EXPRESS APPROVAL IN A 
REFERENDUM.



END
